## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In biblical times, myrrh was a significant aromatic resin used for various religious and medicinal purposes, and it also played an essential role in funeral rites and burial practices. Myrrh is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, most notably in the books of Exodus, Isaiah, and Psalms.

In the Book of Exodus (30:23), myrrh is one of the ingredients used in the holy anointing oil for sacred ceremonies and worship. The Hebrew word for myrrh (מרה) is related to its aromatic qualities, as it means "bitter."

Regarding burial practices, we find an instance of myrrh being used for embalming in the story of Joseph and his brothers in Genesis 37:25. When they sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt, the brothers took off his tunic, dipped it in blood, sent it to their father Jacob, and said that a wild animal had devoured him. To add credibility to their lie, they also brought back some of Joseph's goatskin coat dipped in animal fat and a piece of myrrh as proof of death (Genesis 37:31-32).

Another well-known example is the burial of Jesus Christ, where we find that a mixture of myrrh and aloes was used to anoint his body after his crucifixion (John 19:39-40). This practice of anointing bodies with myrrh was common in Jewish funerary customs as it helped preserve the body and also provided a pleasant fragrance.

So, in summary, myrrh was commonly used in burial practices during biblical times for embalming, anointing, and providing a soothing aroma to honor the deceased.
