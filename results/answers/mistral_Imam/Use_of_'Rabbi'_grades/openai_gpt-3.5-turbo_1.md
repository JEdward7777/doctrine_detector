# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, both John the Baptist (Yahya in Arabic) and Jesus (Isa in Arabic) are considered important prophets of God, but they are not referred to as "Rabbi" in the Islamic context. The title "Rabbi" (Rabb in Arabic) is specifically Jewish and is used for teachers or spiritual leaders within Judaism. As Muslims, we believe that all prophets were simply messengers of God, conveying His message to humanity without personal authority or leadership over other prophets. This is why they are not referred to as "Rabbi" in Islamic tradition.
