However, the response focused solely on the Islamic perspective and did not address the Christian view of John the Baptist and Jesus being referred to in that manner. Additionally, it did not provide any insights from a Christian worldview, which is crucial when discussing figures like John the Baptist and Jesus. In the context of a Christian-specific worldview, the answer lacks doctrinal accuracy and depth."
