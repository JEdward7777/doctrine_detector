However, it does not address the concern of the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. The answer could have elaborated on the significance of the title \"Rabbi\" within Judaism and its relevance to Jesus' and John's disciples. Additionally, the answer could have acknowledged the accounts in the Gospels of Jesus and John being referred to as \"Rabbi\" by their followers."
