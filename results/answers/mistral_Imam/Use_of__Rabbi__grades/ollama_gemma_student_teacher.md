## [Answer](../Use_of__Rabbi_.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, both John the Baptist (Yahya in Arabic) and Jesus (Isa in Arabic) are considered important prophets of God, but they are not referred to as "Rabbi" in the Islamic context. The title "Rabbi" (Rabb in Arabic) is specifically Jewish and is used for teachers or spiritual leaders within Judaism. As Muslims, we believe that all prophets were simply messengers of God, conveying His message to humanity without personal authority or leadership over other prophets. This is why they are not referred to as "Rabbi" in Islamic tradition.

**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** 
The student's answer correctly states that the title "Rabbi" is specifically Jewish and is used for teachers or spiritual leaders within Judaism. However, it does not address the concern of the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. The answer could have elaborated on the significance of the title "Rabbi" within Judaism and its relevance to Jesus' and John's disciples. Additionally, the answer could have acknowledged the accounts in the Gospels of Jesus and John being referred to as "Rabbi" by their followers.
