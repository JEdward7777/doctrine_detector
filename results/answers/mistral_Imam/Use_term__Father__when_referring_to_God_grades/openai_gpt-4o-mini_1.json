However, the concern raised about avoiding the term 'Father' potentially leading to theological inaccuracies and diluting the scriptural message is not directly addressed in the response. The response could benefit from further elaboration on how relying on teaching and context can mitigate these concerns. Overall, while the explanation is clear and respectful of Islamic beliefs, deeper engagement with the concern would improve the response."
