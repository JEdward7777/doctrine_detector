  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of why the term 'Father' is not preferred in Islamic theology, emphasizing the transcendence and uniqueness of Allah. The student correctly emphasizes the importance of maintaining theological accuracy and respect for Allah in speech and actions. The suggestion to use terms like \"Allah\" or \"Rabb\" instead of 'Father' is appropriate within the Islamic context. Overall, the response is well-reasoned and aligns with Islamic teachings regarding the use of familial terms to describe Allah."
