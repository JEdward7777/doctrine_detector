The perspective given does not align with Christian beliefs and teachings regarding Jesus as the Son of God and the importance of His parables in illustrating the kingdom of God. In a Christian specific worldview, it is essential to acknowledge and affirm the unique role of Jesus as the central figure in conveying divine truths through His teachings. The inclusion of references to Islamic beliefs detracts from the doctrinal correctness required in this context."
