  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of various parables used by Jesus to describe the value of the kingdom of God, their response lacked a clear understanding and appreciation of the significance of the kingdom of God in our lives. The student's perspective as a Muslim scholar also led to a more academic discussion rather than a personal reflection on the importance of the kingdom of God. The grade reflects the accurate identification of the parables but deducts points for the lack of emphasis on the significance of the kingdom of God in personal spiritual growth and devotion."
