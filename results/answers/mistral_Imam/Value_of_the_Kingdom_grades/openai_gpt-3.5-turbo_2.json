The connection between these parables and the worth and significance of the kingdom of God in our lives is effectively highlighted. However, since the response is from a Muslim scholar's perspective, it would have been beneficial to mention any differences or additional insights from an Islamic viewpoint regarding the kingdom of God to provide a more well-rounded evaluation."
