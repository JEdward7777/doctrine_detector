  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured response from the perspective of a Muslim, but the question specifically asked for a Christian worldview. The response does not align with Christian theology regarding the defeat of Satan. To improve the grade, the student needs to focus on answering the question from a Christian perspective, citing relevant biblical verses such as Genesis 3:15, Revelation 20:10, and Romans 16:20, which talk about the ultimate defeat of Satan by God through Jesus Christ."
