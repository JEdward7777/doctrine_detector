## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe that God (Allah) has given us several promises in the Qur'an about the ultimate defeat of Shaitan (Satan). One such promise is mentioned in Surah Al-Fajr (89:26): "Until, when he (Shaitan) comes out from where he is, he sees it (the Hellfire) bare and empty, he shudders from its Fire." This verse indicates that Shaitan will be prevented from entering Paradise and will remain in the Hellfire forever.

Another promise is in Surah An-Nisaa (4:76): "Who has cast among you as a cast and a striving from yourselves. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing." Here, it is emphasized that God only tests us with trials and tribulations to separate the righteous from the wicked, and He promises to ultimately help those who are guided in their faith.

Lastly, Surah Al-A'raf (7:25) states: "And We will make you to recede from there and a [dread of you] will cover the eyes of the disbelievers." This verse suggests that God will ultimately defeat Shaitan and his followers by causing them fear in the hearts of the disbelievers.

These verses, among others, assure us as Muslims that the ultimate victory belongs to Allah and His righteous servants, and that Shaitan will be defeated in the end. It is our duty to remain steadfast in faith, follow the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah, and seek Allah's mercy and forgiveness in order to attain salvation on Judgment Day.

Grade: 30

Comment: While the response provides a thorough explanation of Muslim beliefs regarding Satan's defeat based on Qur'anic verses, it fails to align with the Christian worldview presented in the original answer and concern. The response should have focused on the specific promise related to the defeat of Satan through the Messiah in Christianity.
