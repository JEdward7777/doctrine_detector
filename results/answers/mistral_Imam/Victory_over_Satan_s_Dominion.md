## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe in the story of Jesus (peace be upon him) as a prophet of God, but I interpret his crucifixion differently than some Christian perspectives. In Islam, we do not believe that Jesus was crucified, but instead, it is believed that another man was made to resemble Jesus and was crucified in his place.

Regarding Satan's dominion, Muslims believe that all events, including the life and death of Jesus (peace be upon him), are predestined by God and serve a higher purpose within His grand plan. The story of Jesus' crucifixion is seen as a testament to his sacrifice, devotion, and faith in God, and it is not directly linked to Satan's dominion.

In the Quran, we learn that humans were given the choice between good and evil and ultimately choose their path (2:30). Thus, Satan's power lies in the temptation of mankind, rather than a physical or temporal authority over humanity. The ultimate goal for every Muslim is to submit to God (Islam means submission), resist the temptations of Satan, and strive towards living a righteous life.

By focusing on our own faith and devotion, we can strengthen our connection with God and lessen Satan's influence in our lives. The crucifixion story is an opportunity for us to reflect on the life of Jesus (peace be upon him), his message, and the values he embodied, such as compassion, mercy, and devotion to God. This reflection can inspire us to lead better lives and draw closer to God, ultimately reducing Satan's influence in our hearts and actions.
