However, the response does not directly address the Christian-specific worldview concerning Christ's victory over sin and evil through His death on the cross. In a Christian perspective, Christ's victory on the cross is central to salvation and the defeat of Satan's dominion. It would have been beneficial to clearly contrast this Christian belief with the Muslim perspective presented in the response."
