However, from a Christian perspective, the core belief is that Jesus' death on the cross signifies the ultimate victory over sin and evil, breaking Satan's dominion. The response did not directly address this crucial aspect of Christ's victory and its implications for believers' spiritual lives. Moving forward, it would be beneficial to incorporate this central Christian doctrine when discussing the crucifixion of Jesus and its significance."
