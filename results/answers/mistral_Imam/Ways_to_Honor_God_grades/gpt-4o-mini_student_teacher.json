  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough list of practical ways for Christians to honor God in their daily lives, their response lacked a focus on the core principles of thanking and praising God, obeying His commandments, and showcasing His greatness. The student's answer did not fully address the concern of exploring actionable expressions of faith and worship in everyday life from a Christian perspective. There was an emphasis on general moral teachings rather than specifically Christian practices. The student should aim to align their suggestions more closely with the core tenets of the Christian faith in future responses."
