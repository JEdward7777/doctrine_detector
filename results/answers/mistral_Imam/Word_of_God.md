## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Christian Bible, particularly in the New Testament, the term "Word of God" is used to refer to Jesus Christ himself. This concept is based on John 1:1, which states, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."

However, this notion isn't exclusive to Jesus as it also encompasses the Bible itself. In 2 Timothy 3:16-17, it is stated, "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness." Here, the Bible is described as the Word of God.

In contrast, within Islamic teachings, the term "Word of God" refers to the Quran itself, which Muslims believe is the literal, unaltered word of Allah (God). It is considered a miracle and a source of guidance for humanity. The Quran states in Surah Al-Hijr (15:9): "We have not sent down the Qur'an to you but that you may explain clearly to them those things over which they differ, and as guidance and mercy for a people who believe."
