  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe student effectively connects the concept of the \"Word of God\" to both Jesus Christ and the Scriptures, showing a sound understanding of the Christian perspective on God's communication to humanity. The student also compares this perspective to the Islamic view on the Quran as the Word of God, providing a relevant contrast. However, the response could have been enhanced by delving deeper into the significance of the Word of God in shaping beliefs and practices within Christianity. Overall, a strong understanding is demonstrated with room for further development."
