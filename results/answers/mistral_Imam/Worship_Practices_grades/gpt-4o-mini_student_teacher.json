However, the answer seems to primarily focus on comparing Islamic and Christian perspectives on idolatry rather than directly addressing the question within a Christian worldview. The response could be improved by providing more specific and in-depth examples of modern idols that Christians might prioritize over their relationship with God, aligning more closely with the given concern from a Christian perspective."
