The examples given align well with the concern of ensuring devotion to God above all else. However, the integration with Islamic perspectives, while informative, may lead to potential confusion or dilution of the Christian-specific focus. A more distinct emphasis on Christian teachings on idolatry could strengthen the argument from a Christian worldview."
