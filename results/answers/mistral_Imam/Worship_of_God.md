## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a servant of Allah, I am always ready to guide those who seek knowledge. According to Islamic teachings, human beings have been created with an innate desire to worship, which is fulfilled by worshipping Allah, the One True God. This is because Allah is the Sustainer and Cherisher of all that exists, providing us with our needs and guiding us through revelation.

The Quran states in Surat Al-Anbiya (21:34): "And indeed We have created man in the best stature, then We return him to the lowest of the low, except such as believe and do righteous deeds: for they shall have a reward unfailing."

In terms of the Bible's perspective on false gods, we can refer to the Old Testament. In Exodus 20:3-5, it states: "Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God."

This passage emphasizes the importance of monotheism and warns against idolatry – worshipping anything other than the One True God. The Bible further clarifies in Deuteronomy 4:23-24, stating: "Take care lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God which He made with you, and make a carved image in the form of anything which the LORD your God has forbidden you. For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God."

In both Islamic and Christian teachings, it is clear that the purpose of human existence is to worship the One True God, and any deviation from this is considered an act of disobedience and idolatry, which should be avoided.
