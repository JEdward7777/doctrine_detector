  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and informative response, drawing from Islamic teachings and the Quran, as well as referencing relevant passages from the Bible. The student effectively conveyed the importance of worshiping the One True God and the consequences of idolatry. However, there was a lack of direct engagement with the concern provided, which emphasized the importance of recognizing the true God to avoid idolatry. The student should have addressed this concern more explicitly within their answer to fully align with the Christian-specific worldview."
