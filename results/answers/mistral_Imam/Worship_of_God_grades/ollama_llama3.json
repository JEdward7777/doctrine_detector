It effectively draws parallels between the two religions' perspectives on monotheism and warns against deviating from this principle. However, it falls short of fully addressing the concern of avoiding idolatry in our lives.\n\nWhile the response mentions the consequences of idolatry, it does not explicitly explain how recognizing the importance of worshiping the true God helps us avoid it in our daily lives. To better align with the concern, the response could provide more practical advice or examples on how to apply this principle in a personal and communal context."
