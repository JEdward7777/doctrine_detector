The answer appropriately relates 'zeal' to devotion, service, and love for God. However, it would have been beneficial to delve deeper into the unique theological perspectives within Christianity on zeal, such as the distinction between righteous zeal and misguided zeal. Additionally, the comparison to Islamic teachings could be perceived as overlooking significant doctrinal differences."
