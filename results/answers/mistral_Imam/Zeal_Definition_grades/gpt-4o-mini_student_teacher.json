  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a good understanding of zeal in the context of Christian teachings, emphasizing the intense devotion towards God and service. They make appropriate references to biblical examples like Jesus and Paul. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer in the emphasis on promoting good causes rather than obedience specifically. It is important to highlight the importance of obedience in zeal within a Christian worldview."
