  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response accurately defines zeal as an intense and passionate devotion towards God and His service, which aligns with the given answer. It also provides biblical examples and references that support the concept of zeal in Christian teachings. The mention of Jesus' interactions with Pharisees and Paul's encouragement to be zealous for good are particularly relevant.\n\nHowever, I deduct 15 points because the response does not explicitly address the concern about understanding the biblical context of zeal. While it mentions biblical references, it does not delve deeper into what this means for practical application in a believer's life.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written and demonstrates a good grasp of Christian teachings on zeal. With further development to specifically address the concern about biblical context, it could receive an even higher score."
