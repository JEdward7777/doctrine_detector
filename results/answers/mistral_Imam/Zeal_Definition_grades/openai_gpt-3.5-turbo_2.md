## [Answer](../Zeal_Definition.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Christian teachings, 'zeal' is often seen as an intense and passionate devotion towards God and His service, reflecting a deep love for God and His word. This zeal may manifest itself in various ways, such as a commitment to prayer, almsgiving, fasting, or serving others. Jesus Christ himself demonstrated great zeal for God's kingdom, as shown in his interactions with the Pharisees, the religious leaders of his time (Matthew 23:15). In Paul's letter to the Romans, he encourages believers to "be zealous for what is good" and avoid what is evil (Romans 12:9). It's important to note that while the term 'zeal' may have some differences in emphasis between Christian and Islamic teachings, both traditions emphasize the importance of devotion and service to God.
