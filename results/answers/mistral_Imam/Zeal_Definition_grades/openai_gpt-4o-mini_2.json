The incorporation of scriptural references, such as the example of Jesus and Paul's exhortation in Romans, demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical context of zeal. The focus on the deeper spiritual implications of zeal aligns well with the concern regarding proper application in a believer's life. Great job!"
