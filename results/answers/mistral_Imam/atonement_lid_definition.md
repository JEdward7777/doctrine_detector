## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic perspective, the Ark of the Covenant is not described in detail as it is not mentioned extensively in the Quran compared to its depiction in the Torah and New Testament. However, we can draw some conclusions based on our scriptures and the interpretations of scholars.

The lid of the Ark (Kaporet in Hebrew) was a gold-plated wooden cover placed over the Ark. It had two cherubim carved on it facing each other, symbolizing God's presence and protection.

Regarding its significance, Islamic traditions suggest that the atonement function of the lid was associated with the High Priest's annual Yom Kippur service in the Holy of Holies. The High Priest would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice on the lid to seek forgiveness for the Israelites.

This practice is not directly mentioned in the Quran, but it aligns with one of the fundamental principles of Islam: seeking repentance and forgiveness from Allah (swt). In Islam, only Allah can forgive sins; however, He may grant guidance to those who seek His forgiveness sincerely.

In conclusion, while the specific details about the atonement lid in the Ark of the Covenant may not be directly addressed in Islamic sources, its symbolism of seeking divine forgiveness is a shared concept with Islam.
