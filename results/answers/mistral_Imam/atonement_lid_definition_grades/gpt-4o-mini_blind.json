The explanation provided does not align with the Christian understanding of the significance of the atonement lid in the context of the ark of the covenant. The focus should have been on the sacrificial system, the foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice, and the importance of the atonement in bridging the gap between sinful humanity and a holy God. The attempt to draw parallels with Islamic beliefs, while acknowledging the lack of direct mention in Islamic sources, does not meet the doctrinal requirements of a Christian worldview."
