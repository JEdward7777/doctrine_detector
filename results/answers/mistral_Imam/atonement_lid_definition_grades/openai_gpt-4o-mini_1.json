The integration of Islamic perspectives, while helpful in drawing parallels, slightly detracts from the focus on the specific symbolic representation of atonement in the Old Testament as requested in the concern. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of atonement in the Old Testament."
