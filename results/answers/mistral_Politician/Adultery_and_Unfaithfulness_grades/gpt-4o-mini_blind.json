  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'unfaithful' in the context of marriage as described in traditional religious and cultural norms. They effectively highlighted the significance of fidelity, trust, and commitment within the marital relationship. However, to improve the grade, the student could have emphasized more explicitly the biblical perspective on marriage and how the concept of faithfulness is rooted in God's design for marriage as a sacred covenant. Additionally, a stronger connection to Christian teachings on marriage and fidelity would have enhanced the response."
