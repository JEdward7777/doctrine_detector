  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how the term 'unfaithful' relates to marriage, touching on the breach of trust and violation of marital vows. They also noted the importance of fidelity in upholding the sanctity of the union. However, the student missed the opportunity to connect the concept of unfaithfulness in marriage to the deeper spiritual significance, specifically Israel's unfaithfulness to God as noted in the teacher's reference answer. Incorporating this spiritual perspective would have enhanced the depth of their response within a Christian worldview."
