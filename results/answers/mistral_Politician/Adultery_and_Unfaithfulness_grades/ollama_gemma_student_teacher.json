They clearly explain that faithfulness involves exclusivity and upholding the sanctity of the union. Additionally, they acknowledge the variations in definitions and expectations in modern society. However, the connection to Israel's unfaithfulness to God could be further elaborated to strengthen the Christian-specific worldview perspective."
