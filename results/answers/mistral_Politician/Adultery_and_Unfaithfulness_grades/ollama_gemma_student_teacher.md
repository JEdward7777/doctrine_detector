## [Answer](../Adultery_and_Unfaithfulness.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the context of marriage, as described in traditional religious and cultural norms, 'unfaithful' refers to a spouse who engages in romantic or sexual activity outside their marriage. Monogamy, which is a common expectation within marriage, implies that each partner will be faithful to the other exclusively, thereby upholding the sanctity and commitment of the union. The term 'unfaithfulness' suggests a breach of trust and a violation of the marital vows, often leading to feelings of betrayal and hurt for the wronged party. It is important to note that in modern society, definitions and expectations around marriage and fidelity can vary widely depending on personal beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and societal norms.
