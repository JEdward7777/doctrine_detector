It fails to address the theological purpose behind the command to celebrate Passover as outlined in the Bible. The emphasis should be on the covenantal relationship between God and the Israelites and the foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate Passover Lamb. While cultural and historical aspects are mentioned, the theological significance is essential for a comprehensive understanding. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more focused and explicit connection to the biblical narrative and the core tenets of the Christian faith."
