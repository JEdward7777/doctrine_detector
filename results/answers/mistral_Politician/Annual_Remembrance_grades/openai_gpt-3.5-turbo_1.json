However, it fails to address the concern raised regarding the importance of remembrance in Christian faith. From a Christian worldview, it is crucial to emphasize the parallels between Passover and the concept of remembrance in Christianity, particularly in relation to the sacrificial aspect of Passover pointing towards the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Encouraging deeper reflection on the spiritual implications of remembrance within the context of Passover would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
