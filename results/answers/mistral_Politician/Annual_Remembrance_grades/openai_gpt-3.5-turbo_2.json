However, it falls short in explicitly connecting the concept of remembrance in Passover to the Christian faith's emphasis on remembrance, such as the remembrance of Jesus' sacrifice through communion. A stronger emphasis on the shared importance of remembrance in both the Jewish Passover tradition and the Christian faith would have improved the response."
