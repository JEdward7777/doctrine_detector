  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a nuanced and thoughtful response that acknowledges the importance of respect and sensitivity when discussing religious interpretations. They correctly identify the Apostle John's description of an \"antichrist\" as anyone who denies the divinity or humanity of Jesus Christ. The student's response aligns well with the reference answer and demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical text. However, the emphasis on open dialogue, understanding, and tolerance could be further elaborated to address the specified concern about recognizing and resisting false teachings."
