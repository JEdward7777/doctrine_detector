It aligns well with the concern provided, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and resisting false teachings. The inclusion of a scriptural reference from the New Testament further strengthens the argument. The only minor area for improvement could be to explicitly mention the importance of discernment and staying true to the teachings of Jesus Christ in detecting and confronting antichrists."
