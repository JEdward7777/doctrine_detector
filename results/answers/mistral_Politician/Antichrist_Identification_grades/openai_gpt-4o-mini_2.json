The reference to the Apostle John in the New Testament further supports this understanding. The emphasis on recognizing and resisting false teachings aligns well with the concern provided. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly stating the importance of discernment and adherence to biblical truth in identifying and combating false teachings."
