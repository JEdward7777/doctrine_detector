  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a strong understanding of the role of the apostles in relation to the Great Commission, acknowledging their pivotal role in the early church and their authority from Christ. The response appropriately emphasizes the significance of the apostles as witnesses of Jesus's teachings and their mission to spread the Gospel. Additionally, it maintains respect for religious traditions and beliefs. The only minor critique is that the response could have further elaborated on the specific charge given to the apostles in the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to obey all of Christ's commands."
