  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a well-articulated and thoughtful response on applying the principle of reconciliation in relationships. While the suggestions offered are generally positive and practical, there are significant omissions in addressing the Christian worldview specifically. The response lacks clear integration of biblical references or theological foundations that underpin reconciliation in Christianity. Additionally, there is an absence of emphasis on the importance of repentance, forgiveness through Christ, and the centrality of the gospel in fostering true reconciliation. Integrating these key Christian doctrines would greatly enhance the depth and accuracy of the response."
