  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of practical ways in which Christians can apply the principle of reconciliation in their relationships with others. They emphasized important aspects such as empathy, tolerance, dialogue, love, and community service. However, the answer lacked a direct reference to the core Christian belief of forgiveness through Jesus and reflecting God's compassionate love, which is essential in understanding the true source and motivation for reconciliation in a Christian worldview. The student's suggestions are valuable but could be strengthened by grounding them more explicitly in Christian teachings on forgiveness and redemption."
