The suggestions offered are rooted in Christian values such as empathy, tolerance, love, compassion, humility, and promoting peace. The response could be enhanced by explicitly linking these practical actions back to the core Christian belief of forgiveness through Jesus, which is crucial for fostering reconciliation.
