  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response accurately acknowledges the unique position of Archangel Michael as the only angel referred to as an \"archangel\" in the Bible, aligning with Christian teachings. It appropriately highlights how recognizing Michael's unique position can influence one's understanding of spiritual warfare and intercession. The only reason for not giving a perfect score is the lack of further elaboration or depth in the response."
