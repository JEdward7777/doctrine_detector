  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the student provides a neutral and factual overview of the Ark of the Covenant, their answer lacks a clear acknowledgment of the significance of God's laws and His relationship with His chosen people in the context of the Ark. The answer could have been improved by emphasizing the covenant aspect and the importance of obedience to God's laws as represented by the Ark."
