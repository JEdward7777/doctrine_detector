However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on the importance of God's laws and His relationship with His chosen people through the Ark of the Covenant, which is a central concern from a Christian worldview. It could have further highlighted how the Ark symbolized God's covenant and the obedience to His laws, which would have enriched the understanding of the topic within a Christian context."
