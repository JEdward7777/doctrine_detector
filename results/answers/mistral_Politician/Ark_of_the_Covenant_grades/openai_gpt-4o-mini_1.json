While it acknowledges the importance of the Ark within Jewish history and religious practices, it misses the opportunity to emphasize the significance of God's covenant and presence among His people as portrayed in the Bible. To align more closely with a Christian worldview, the response could have highlighted the divine origin and purpose of the Ark in reinforcing the relationship between God and the Israelites through His laws."
