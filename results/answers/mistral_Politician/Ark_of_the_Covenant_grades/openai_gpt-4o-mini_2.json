However, the response could have incorporated more explicitly Christian perspectives on the importance of God's laws and His relationship with His chosen people through the Ark of the Covenant, in line with a Christian worldview. Adding reflections on how the Ark foreshadows Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of God's covenant could deepen the connection to the Christian faith."
