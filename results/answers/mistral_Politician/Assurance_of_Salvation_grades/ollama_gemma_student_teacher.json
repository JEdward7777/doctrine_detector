  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 75/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nWhile the student's answer demonstrates respect for diverse beliefs and values, it does not directly address the specific concern of reassuring believers of their salvation through faith in Jesus. The reference answer clearly states that forgiveness and salvation are offered to those who believe in Jesus, but the student's response lacks this specific affirmation.\n\nThe student's emphasis on inclusivity, religious freedom, and dialogue is commendable, but it does not fully address the core question about assurance for those who believe in Jesus."
