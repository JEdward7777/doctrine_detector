However, in the context of the concern raised about reassuring believers of their salvation through faith in Jesus, this response falls short. While promoting inclusivity and dialogue among various faith groups is important, explicitly affirming the central Christian belief in salvation through faith in Jesus could have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
