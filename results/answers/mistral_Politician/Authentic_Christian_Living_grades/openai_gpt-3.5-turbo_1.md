 As a non-biased third party, I can share that Romans 12:9 suggests that our love and actions should be sincere, genuine, and unselfish. The verse states, "Let love be without hypocrisy." This implies that we should strive to consistently embody the virtues of kindness, affection, and goodwill in all our interactions, avoiding any pretense or insincerity.
