  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student has provided a generally well-explained and informative answer regarding divine authority from a religious perspective. However, there are some concerns from a Christian worldview. The student's response touches on the concept of divine authority and its significance in the life of a believer, but it lacks a clear emphasis on the significance of divine authority in discerning God's will and maintaining obedience in the faith journey, as outlined in the concern. Additionally, the answer's attempt to maintain neutrality and political correctness may dilute the importance of aligning with God's authority as the ultimate guide for believers. A stronger connection to the reference answer and a clearer emphasis on the importance of divine authority in discerning God's will and maintaining obedience would have improved the response."
