However, it does not explicitly address the concern of how understanding divine authority helps believers discern God's will and maintain obedience in their faith journey. It could have been improved by connecting the concept of divine authority more directly to the idea of discerning God's will and obedience in the context of the believer's faith journey. Nonetheless, the response overall demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
