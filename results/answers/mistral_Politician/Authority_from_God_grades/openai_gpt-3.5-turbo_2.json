  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of divine authority from a religious perspective, emphasizing its importance in guiding believers' moral and spiritual decisions. The concept is well-understood and articulated in a respectful manner. The only suggestion for improvement would be to highlight the aspect of obedience to God's will more explicitly throughout the response."
