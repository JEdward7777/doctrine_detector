  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a general explanation of divine authority from a religious perspective, highlighting its importance in guiding believers in their moral and spiritual decisions. However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern about how understanding divine authority helps believers discern God's will and maintain obedience in their faith journey. The response focuses more on the concept of divine authority itself rather than its practical implications for believers. It could have been strengthened by connecting the explanation to the specific concern raised in the prompt."
