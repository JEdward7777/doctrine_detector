  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the Biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers over their citizens. They correctly referenced key passages from Romans and 1 Peter, highlighting the importance of submission to authority while also emphasizing the distinction between blind obedience and standing up against injustice in accordance with God's will. The response could have been strengthened by including additional references or elaborating further on the responsibility of rulers to govern justly in alignment with God's principles."
