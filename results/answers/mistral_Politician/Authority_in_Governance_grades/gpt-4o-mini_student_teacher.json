  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that references key Bible passages on the authority of governing rulers over citizens. They accurately highlighted the importance of submission to authorities while also mentioning the distinction between blind obedience and standing up against injustice. The student effectively tied these concepts back to the ultimate authority of God. It would have been even stronger if they had directly quoted the reference answer provided by the teacher to demonstrate their understanding of the specific concern. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
