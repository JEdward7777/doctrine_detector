  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 95.\n\nThe response accurately quotes Romans 13:1-2, which supports the idea that governing authorities have been established by God. It also correctly identifies the importance of respecting those in positions of authority as ordained by God. The response goes further to clarify that this does not mean blind obedience to unjust or immoral laws, but rather an understanding of a higher order at work.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from more depth and nuance in its exploration of the biblical passages. For example, it would be helpful to discuss how these passages apply to different scenarios, such as when governing authorities are clearly unjust or immoral, or when citizens have a responsibility to speak truthfully and stand up against injustice.\n\nOverall, however, this response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey."
