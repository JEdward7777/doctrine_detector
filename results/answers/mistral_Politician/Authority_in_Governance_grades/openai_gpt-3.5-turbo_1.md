# Stated Concern
Understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey

# Answer by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the Bible, there are several passages that address the relationship between governing authorities and citizens. One of the most well-known is found in Romans 13:1-7, which states: "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God."

This passage emphasizes the importance of obeying and respecting those in positions of authority, as they are ultimately appointed by God. It does not mean blind obedience to unjust or immoral laws, but rather an understanding that there is a higher order at work, even when we may not fully understand it ourselves.

Another important passage can be found in 1 Peter 2:13-14, which says: "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right."

In both of these passages, the Bible stresses the importance of submission to governing authorities out of respect for God's divine order. However, it is important to note that this does not mean unquestioning obedience or the acceptance of injustice. As followers of Christ, we are called to live with integrity, speak truthfully, and stand up against injustice when necessary. Ultimately, our ultimate allegiance is to God and His will.
