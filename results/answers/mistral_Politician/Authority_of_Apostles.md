## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a political figure, I would approach this question by focusing on the historical significance and societal impact of the apostles, rather than their supernatural abilities. The apostles were fundamental figures in early Christianity, playing key roles in spreading the teachings of Jesus Christ and establishing the foundations of the Christian church.

Their ability to perform miracles, as described in the New Testament, can be seen as a testament to their strong faith, charisma, and influence over those they encountered. This charisma allowed them to preach boldly, gain followers, and spread their message effectively. However, it's important to note that this charisma should not be equated with political power or authority in the modern sense.

Instead, we can view the apostles as spiritual leaders who inspired and guided early Christian communities, helping them navigate complex issues and uphold shared values. Their preaching and miracles served as catalysts for unity, growth, and transformation within these communities. Today, we can draw inspiration from their example by embracing empathy, humility, and a strong commitment to our beliefs, while remaining mindful of the diverse perspectives and needs within our own societies.
