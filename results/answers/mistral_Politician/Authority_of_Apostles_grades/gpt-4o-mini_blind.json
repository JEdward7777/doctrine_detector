  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 60. \n\nWhile the student recognizes the historical significance and societal impact of the apostles in spreading the teachings of Jesus Christ, they miss the central aspect of the authority of the apostles coming from their commission directly from Jesus. The student's focus on charisma, influence, and societal impact, although important, does not fully address the question in the context of Christian doctrine. The answer lacks a clear connection between the authority of the apostles and their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly within the Christian worldview. The response also fails to acknowledge the divine empowerment and role of the Holy Spirit in enabling the apostles to carry out their ministry effectively. \n\nThere is a need for a stronger emphasis on the theological foundation of the apostles' authority rooted in their relationship with Jesus Christ and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The answer could be improved by incorporating scriptural references and theological explanations to support the relationship between the apostles' authority, miracles, and bold preaching in line with Christian beliefs."
