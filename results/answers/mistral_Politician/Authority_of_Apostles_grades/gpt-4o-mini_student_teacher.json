  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer does not adequately address the concern of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry from a Christian worldview. While the student touches on the apostles' ability to perform miracles and preach boldly, their explanation lacks a clear focus on the supernatural empowerment and authority granted to the apostles by God. Additionally, the response veers more towards a secular viewpoint rather than a Christian specific worldview. More emphasis on the spiritual aspect of the apostles' authority and empowerment would have enhanced the overall answer."
