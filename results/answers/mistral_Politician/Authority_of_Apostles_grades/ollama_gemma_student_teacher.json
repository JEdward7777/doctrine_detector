  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer thoughtfully addresses the concern by exploring the connection between the apostles' authority and their miraculous abilities in the context of early Christianity. They avoid simplistic political interpretations and instead offer a nuanced understanding of the apostles as spiritual leaders. The inclusion of historical and societal context adds depth to their analysis. While the answer doesn't explicitly mention the divine empowerment mentioned in the concern, it implicitly acknowledges it by suggesting the apostles' abilities were beyond human explanation."
