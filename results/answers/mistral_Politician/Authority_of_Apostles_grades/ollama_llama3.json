  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, but it does not fully explore this concern as much as I would have liked to see. The response provides some insightful points about the apostles' charisma and influence, and how they inspired and guided early Christian communities. However, it does not delve as deeply into the biblical accounts of their divine empowerment and authority.\n\nThe response also misses an opportunity to fully explore the implications of this concern for modern-day ministry and leadership. While it mentions some general principles that can be drawn from the apostles' example, such as embracing empathy, humility, and a strong commitment to one's beliefs, it does not provide specific examples or applications of how these principles can be applied in contemporary contexts.\n\nOverall, while this response is well-written and demonstrates some understanding of the concern, I would have liked to see more explicit exploration of the biblical accounts and more practical application of the principles that can be drawn from the apostles' example."
