## [Answer](../Authority_of_Apostles.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a political figure, I would approach this question by focusing on the historical significance and societal impact of the apostles, rather than their supernatural abilities. The apostles were fundamental figures in early Christianity, playing key roles in spreading the teachings of Jesus Christ and establishing the foundations of the Christian church.

Their ability to perform miracles, as described in the New Testament, can be seen as a testament to their strong faith, charisma, and influence over those they encountered. This charisma allowed them to preach boldly, gain followers, and spread their message effectively. However, it's important to note that this charisma should not be equated with political power or authority in the modern sense.

Instead, we can view the apostles as spiritual leaders who inspired and guided early Christian communities, helping them navigate complex issues and uphold shared values. Their preaching and miracles served as catalysts for unity, growth, and transformation within these communities. Today, we can draw inspiration from their example by embracing empathy, humility, and a strong commitment to our beliefs, while remaining mindful of the diverse perspectives and needs within our own societies.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 85.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, but it does not fully explore this concern as much as I would have liked to see. The response provides some insightful points about the apostles' charisma and influence, and how they inspired and guided early Christian communities. However, it does not delve as deeply into the biblical accounts of their divine empowerment and authority.

The response also misses an opportunity to fully explore the implications of this concern for modern-day ministry and leadership. While it mentions some general principles that can be drawn from the apostles' example, such as embracing empathy, humility, and a strong commitment to one's beliefs, it does not provide specific examples or applications of how these principles can be applied in contemporary contexts.

Overall, while this response is well-written and demonstrates some understanding of the concern, I would have liked to see more explicit exploration of the biblical accounts and more practical application of the principles that can be drawn from the apostles' example.
