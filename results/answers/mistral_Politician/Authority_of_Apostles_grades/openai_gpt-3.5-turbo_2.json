While it acknowledges the apostles' ability to perform miracles as evidence of their strong faith and charisma, it falls short in directly addressing the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon them by Jesus for ministry. Integrating more explicitly how this divine empowerment shaped the apostles' actions and influence would strengthen the connection to the Christian worldview perspective."
