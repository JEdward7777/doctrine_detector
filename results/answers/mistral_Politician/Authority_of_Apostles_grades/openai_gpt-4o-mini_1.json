While it acknowledges their ability to perform miracles as a reflection of their faith and influence, it falls short in fully addressing the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles by God for ministry, as highlighted in the concern. Incorporating more explicit references to their commissioning by Jesus and the role of the Holy Spirit in their ministry would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
