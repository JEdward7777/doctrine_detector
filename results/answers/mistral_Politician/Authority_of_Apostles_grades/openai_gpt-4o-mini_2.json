However, it falls short in directly addressing the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry as outlined in the provided answer and concern. While it acknowledges their ability to perform miracles as a testament to their strong faith, charisma, and influence, it could have delved deeper into how this divine empowerment shaped their ministry and leadership. Overall, a good analysis but lacking in full alignment with the Christian worldview focus on divine empowerment and authority."
