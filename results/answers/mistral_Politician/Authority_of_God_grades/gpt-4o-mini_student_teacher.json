  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the term \"Yahweh of hosts\" and its significance in relation to God's authority over spiritual beings, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how understanding God's authority can deepen faith and trust in His omnipotence. The only room for improvement would be to further focus on the central theme of God's authority over spiritual beings, as highlighted in the reference answer."
