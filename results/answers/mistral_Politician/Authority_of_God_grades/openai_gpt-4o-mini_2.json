It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how understanding God's authority can deepen faith and trust in His omnipotence. The response could have further elaborated on the implications of this understanding for believers in terms of practical application or personal reflection, but overall, it demonstrates a strong grasp of the theological concept and its relevance for faith."
