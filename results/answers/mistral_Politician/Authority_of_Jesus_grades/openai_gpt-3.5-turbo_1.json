While the perspective presented acknowledges the political significance of the title during Jesus' time, it falls short of fully embracing the Christian worldview concerning Jesus' divine authority over all creation. The mention of Jesus' unique and spiritual relationship with God is a step in the right direction, but a more explicit affirmation of Jesus' divine kingship and authority over all creation would strengthen the response in addressing believers' acknowledgment of His sovereignty in their lives."
