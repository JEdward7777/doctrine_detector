However, the response falls short in fully addressing the concern about understanding Jesus' authority as it relates to believers acknowledging His sovereignty in their lives. The discussion about Jesus' authority over all creation as tied to His divine kingship could have been further explored and connected to believers' recognition of His sovereignty. Overall, while informative, the response could have delved deeper into the specific concern provided."
