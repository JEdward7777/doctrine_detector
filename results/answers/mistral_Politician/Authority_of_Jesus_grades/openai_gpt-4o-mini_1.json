However, it approached the concern of understanding Jesus' authority from a more general perspective, rather than emphasizing His divine kingship over all creation as the provided answer did. To align more closely with the Christian worldview, the response could have further emphasized Jesus' sovereignty and divine authority over all creation in a more explicit manner."
