However, it missed the opportunity to delve deeper into the theological underpinnings of parental authority as derived from scripture. A stronger response would have explored the concept of stewardship, God's design for the family structure, and the responsibility of parents in shaping the spiritual and moral development of their children. Additionally, emphasizing the divine mandate for parental authority within the context of God's overall plan for families would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
