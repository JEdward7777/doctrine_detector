## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the Judaic tradition, the authorship of the Psalms is attributed to various individuals who are considered to be important figures in Jewish history and tradition. Here are a few key figures associated with the composition of the Psalms:

1. King David: Often regarded as the primary author of the Psalms, King David was a skilled musician, poet, and warrior who ruled over Israel around 1000 BCE. According to Jewish tradition, he wrote many of the psalms, which reflect his personal experiences and deep emotions.

2. Asaph: A Levite, Asaph is mentioned several times in the Book of Psalms as a musician and choir leader who led worship at the temple in Jerusalem. Tradition suggests that some of the Psalms were written by members of the Asaphite family.

3. Moses: Some psalms are attributed to Moses, although it is unclear whether he actually wrote them or if they were composed later and associated with him due to his prestigious status as the Lawgiver of Israel.

4. Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman the Ezrahite, and Kalal the Ezrahite: These three figures are mentioned in 1 Chronicles 6:31-32 as musicians who were given the task of composing psalms for King David.

5. The Sons of Korah: A group of Levites who were descendants of Korah, a cousin of Moses and Aaron (Numbers 16). They are credited with writing several psalms in the Bible.
