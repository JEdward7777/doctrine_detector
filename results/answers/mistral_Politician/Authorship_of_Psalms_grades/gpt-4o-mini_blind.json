The mention of King David as the primary author, along with other significant individuals like Asaph, Moses, Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman the Ezrahite, and the Sons of Korah, aligns with Christian beliefs about the authorship of the Psalms. The response could have been improved by emphasizing the divine inspiration behind the Psalms, as in Christian theology, it is crucial to recognize that these writings were ultimately inspired by God."
