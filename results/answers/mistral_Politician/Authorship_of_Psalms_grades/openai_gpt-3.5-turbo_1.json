By expanding on the initial answer and including additional specific figures like Asaph, Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman the Ezrahite, Kalal the Ezrahite, and the Sons of Korah, it demonstrates a deeper understanding of the diversity of authorship behind the Psalms. This enriches the understanding of the Psalms' messages and themes by acknowledging the varied backgrounds and perspectives of the individuals credited with their composition."
