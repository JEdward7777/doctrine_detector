From a Christian worldview, the term 'Son of God' is a foundational belief regarding the nature of Jesus Christ as the second person of the Trinity. The suggested alternative terms like 'Jesus Christ,' 'Savior,' or 'Messiah' do not fully capture the theological richness and truth conveyed by the term 'Son of God.' It is important to emphasize the importance of maintaining doctrinal accuracy and clarity in translation efforts, even when communicating with different cultures."
