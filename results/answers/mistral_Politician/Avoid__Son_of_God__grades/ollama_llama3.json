  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern that avoidance can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. The author suggests using alternative terms like \"Jesus Christ,\" \"Savior,\" or \"Messiah\" when communicating with people from polytheistic cultures, which acknowledges the importance of contextualizing Christian terminology to avoid misunderstanding.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have more explicitly emphasized the value of carefully teaching the meaning of the term \"Son of God\" through context and explanation, as suggested by the answer. While the author does mention the importance of clear and respectful communication, they do not directly address the concern about avoidance leading to theological gaps.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively navigates the concern and provides practical suggestions for promoting understanding between people from different backgrounds."
