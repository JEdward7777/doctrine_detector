However, the suggestion to avoid the term 'Son of God' in favor of more neutral terms like 'Jesus Christ' or 'Savior' does not address the concern that avoidance can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. It is crucial to uphold the accurate and profound theological significance of Jesus being the Son of God, and avoiding the term altogether could dilute the core beliefs of Christianity. The response falls short in addressing the concern effectively from a Christian worldview."
