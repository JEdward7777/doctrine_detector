  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response does not align with a Christian worldview, as it suggests avoiding using the term 'Son of God' to prevent misunderstandings in different cultural contexts. In a Christian perspective, it is crucial to uphold the theological truth of Jesus being the Son of God and to teach and explain this concept rather than avoiding it. By avoiding the term, theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity could indeed occur, as the concern rightly points out. The response does not address the concern adequately and does not affirm the importance of accurately conveying Christian beliefs, leading to a lower grade."
