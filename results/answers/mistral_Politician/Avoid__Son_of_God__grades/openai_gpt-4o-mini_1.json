As a Christian, it is crucial to uphold the truth and importance of Jesus' identity as the Son of God, rather than potentially diluting or avoiding this core belief. Teaching the meaning through context and explanation is indeed important, but avoiding the term altogether can create theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity, which is a significant concern from a Christian worldview."
