However, it falls short of fully addressing the concern about avoiding the term 'Son of God.' While it suggests using alternative terms, it does not emphasize the importance of teaching and explaining the theological significance behind the term. Encouraging clear communication while ensuring the preservation of essential theological truths is crucial within a Christian worldview."
