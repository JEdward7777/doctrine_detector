  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the different methods of baptism mentioned in the Bible and how they are interpreted in various Christian contexts. They demonstrated an understanding of the diversity in baptismal practices among different denominations. However, there was some additional information in the response that was not directly related to the concern of clarifying interpretations and methods of baptism. This led to a slight deviation from the primary focus of the question."
