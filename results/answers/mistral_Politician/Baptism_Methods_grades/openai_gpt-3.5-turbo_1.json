The explanation is clear, concise, and well-supported with biblical references. It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the interpretations and methods of baptism within the Christian faith. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include a brief mention of the theological significance and symbolism associated with each method of baptism from a Christian worldview."
