## [Answer](../Baptism_Methods.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the New Testament of the Bible, there are three primary methods of baptism mentioned: immersion (full submersion), affusion (pouring or aspersion), and infancy baptism. Each method has been interpreted differently across various Christian denominations based on their beliefs, traditions, and interpretations of Scripture.

1. Immersion (Full Submersion): This is the most common image of baptism in the New Testament, where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan River (Matthew 3:16). Immersion symbolizes burial with Christ and resurrection to new life (Romans 6:4). Most Baptist and Pentecostal churches practice immersion baptism.

2. Affusion (Pouring or Aspersion): This method involves pouring water over the head of the person being baptized, and it is also mentioned in the New Testament when Peter baptized Cornelius and his household (Acts 10:47-48). Some Baptist churches, Anglican churches, Episcopalian churches, and Methodist churches practice affusion baptism.

3. Infant Baptism: This method is a practice in some Christian denominations, including the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and many Protestant churches such as Lutherans and Reformed churches. They believe that infants can be saved and should be baptized as a sign of God's covenantal promise to them. Some Baptist and Pentecostal churches do not practice infant baptism but instead wait until the person has made a conscious decision to follow Christ, often around the age of accountability or adulthood.

When engaging in dialogue with people from different Christian traditions, it is essential to approach the conversation with respect for their beliefs and understanding that each denomination has its unique interpretations and practices based on Scripture and tradition. In order to build bridges and promote unity within Christianity, it's essential to focus on shared values, love, compassion, and seeking God's will together rather than emphasizing differences in baptismal practices.
