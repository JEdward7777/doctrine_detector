It references relevant biblical passages and explains the symbolic and spiritual importance of baptism well. To enhance the answer further, the student could deepen the explanation on the spiritual implications of baptism, such as dying to sin and rising to new life in Christ, in line with Romans 6:3-4. Additionally, emphasizing the role of baptism as a public proclamation of faith and commitment to following Jesus could strengthen the response."
