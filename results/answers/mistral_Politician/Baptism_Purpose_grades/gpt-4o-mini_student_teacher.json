  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of baptism according to New Testament teachings, incorporating relevant biblical verses. However, the student's answer was more detailed and broader than the reference answer provided by the teacher. While the student highlighted various aspects of baptism, such as new life in Christ, public declaration of faith, forgiveness of sins, and entry into the Christian community, the main focus of baptism - cleansing from sin and unity with Christ - as per the reference answer was somewhat lost in the student's response. A more focused and concise explanation directly addressing the significance of cleansing from sin and unity with Christ would have aligned better with the teacher's reference answer."
