  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the traditional Christian understanding of repentance and baptism in relation to each other, citing relevant biblical passages and explaining the significance of both concepts. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly stating the relationship as a prerequisite for baptism, as indicated in the reference answer. More emphasis on the connection between repentance and the act of baptism would have strengthened the overall explanation from a Christian worldview."
