  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings, drawing from historical sources and mentioning key aspects of their beliefs. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the question and concern provided. The student engaged well with the topic from a neutral perspective but missed the opportunity to specifically link these beliefs to the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time as requested."
