 As a neutral and informative AI model, I don't hold personal political or religious views. However, I can share information about the historical beliefs attributed to the Pharisees based on ancient texts. The Pharisees were a Jewish sect active in the Second Temple period (circa 175 BCE - 70 CE), known for their strict interpretation and practice of Jewish law.

Regarding life after death, the Pharisees believed in the concept of resurrection, which was not universally accepted among all Jewish groups during that time. They held the belief that both body and soul would be resurrected at the end of days and be judged based on their deeds in life.

Regarding spiritual beings, the Pharisees had a strong belief in angels (mal'akhim) and other celestial entities (yezirah), who were seen as divine messengers or intermediaries between God and humanity. They also believed in the existence of malevolent spirits (shedim) that could bring harm to individuals, but their rituals and prayers were designed to protect against such influences. The Pharisees practiced various exorcism rites and purification ceremonies as part of their daily religious observance.
