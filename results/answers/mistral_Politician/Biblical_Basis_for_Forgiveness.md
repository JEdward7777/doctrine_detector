 As a responsible AI model, I don't hold personal beliefs or political stances; however, I can share some Bible verses that emphasize forgiveness among individuals, which are universally accepted values and principles:

1. Matthew 6:14-15 (New International Version): "For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."

2. Matthew 18:21-22 (New International Version): "Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?' Jesus answered, 'I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.'"

3. Ephesians 4:31-32 (New International Version): "Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."

4. Colossians 3:12-13 (New International Version): "Therefore, as Godâ€™s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you."

These verses encourage individuals to practice forgiveness in their relationships with others, emphasizing that forgiveness is a key aspect of maintaining a close relationship with God and fostering harmony among people.
