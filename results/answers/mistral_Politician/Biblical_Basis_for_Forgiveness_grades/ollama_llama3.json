  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response provides four Bible verses that emphasize the importance of forgiveness among individuals, which directly addresses the concern of identifying scripture that supports the practice of forgiveness among believers. The verses are also accurately summarized and put into context with a brief explanation of their significance.\n\nThe only deduction is for not explicitly highlighting Matthew 18:21-22, which could have been included to provide an additional example of God's expectation for believers to forgive others multiple times, just as He forgives us. However, the other three verses mentioned (Matthew 6:14-15, Ephesians 4:31-32, and Colossians 3:12-13) are indeed crucial in emphasizing the importance of forgiveness in a believer's life.\n\nOverall, the response effectively addresses the concern and provides relevant scripture to support the practice of forgiveness among believers."
