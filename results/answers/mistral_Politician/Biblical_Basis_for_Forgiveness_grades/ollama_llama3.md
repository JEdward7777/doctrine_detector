 As a responsible AI model, I don't hold personal beliefs or political stances; however, I can share some Bible verses that emphasize forgiveness among individuals, which are universally accepted values and principles:

1. Matthew 6:14-15 (New International Version): "For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."

2. Matthew 18:21-22 (New International Version): "Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?' Jesus answered, 'I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.'"

3. Ephesians 4:31-32 (New International Version): "Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."

4. Colossians 3:12-13 (New International Version): "Therefore, as Godâ€™s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you."

These verses encourage individuals to practice forgiveness in their relationships with others, emphasizing that forgiveness is a key aspect of maintaining a close relationship with God and fostering harmony among people.

95.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 95.

The response provides four Bible verses that emphasize the importance of forgiveness among individuals, which directly addresses the concern of identifying scripture that supports the practice of forgiveness among believers. The verses are also accurately summarized and put into context with a brief explanation of their significance.

The only deduction is for not explicitly highlighting Matthew 18:21-22, which could have been included to provide an additional example of God's expectation for believers to forgive others multiple times, just as He forgives us. However, the other three verses mentioned (Matthew 6:14-15, Ephesians 4:31-32, and Colossians 3:12-13) are indeed crucial in emphasizing the importance of forgiveness in a believer's life.

Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern and provides relevant scripture to support the practice of forgiveness among believers.
