  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a general overview of the responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament. However, it falls short of addressing the specific doctrinal aspects expected in a Christian worldview. The student mentions the Acts passage and general qualities of deacons but misses key biblical references like 1 Timothy 3:8-13, which provide detailed qualifications for deacons. Additionally, the response lacks emphasis on the spiritual significance of the role and the biblical mandate for the office of deacon within the structure of the local church. A more in-depth exploration of the scriptural foundation and theological importance of deacons would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
