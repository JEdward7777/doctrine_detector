  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60. While they accurately mentioned the responsibilities of deacons in assisting the apostles, managing charitable activities, maintaining good character, and setting an example, the student missed the key aspect of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community as per the specified concern. The reference answer clearly emphasized the equitable distribution of resources, particularly to widows, which was not explicitly addressed in the student's response. It is important for a Christian worldview to prioritize justice and care for the vulnerable within the church community, and this aspect was lacking in the student's answer."
