The incorporation of the New Testament's teachings on deacons aligns well with the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care. The response could have further emphasized the importance of upholding Christian values and integrity in carrying out these responsibilities, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern in a Christian worldview context."
