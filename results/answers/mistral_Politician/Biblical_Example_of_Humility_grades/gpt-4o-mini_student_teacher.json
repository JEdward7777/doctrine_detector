  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response discussing the humility of Moses, a significant figure in the Old Testament. While Moses is indeed an excellent example of humility, the question specifically asked for an example character who exemplified humility, and the reference answer provided David as an example. It would have been more appropriate for the student to focus on David as per the teacher's reference answer. However, the student effectively highlighted Moses' humility and backed it up with relevant scriptural references."
