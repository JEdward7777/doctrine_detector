  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided insightful examples of biblical figures known for their blamelessness and drew relevant lessons from their lives. However, the answer did not align perfectly with the teacher's reference answer, which specifically highlighted Abraham and Noah. The student's answer demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of blamelessness in the lives of Joseph, Daniel, Noah, and Job, but fell short in directly addressing the concern of studying these specific biblical figures to understand the practical application of blamelessness. Strong connection to the reference answer and ensuring alignment with the specified concern could have improved the grade in this case."
