  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: \nThe student provided insightful examples of God's blessings in the Bible, showing an understanding of how blessings are illustrated. However, they missed the specific example given in Genesis 1:22 where God blesses the creatures of the sea and the birds. Encouraging the student to incorporate this example will help strengthen their answer and align it more closely with the given reference answer."
