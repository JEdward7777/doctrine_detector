  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the response does discuss God's blessings in Scripture, it only partially addresses the concern of illustrating how blessings are depicted in scripture. The examples provided from Genesis do show God's blessings upon His creation and chosen ones, but they do not specifically address the verse provided (Genesis 1:22) or provide a clear connection to the concern.\n\nA score of 60 is given because the response does demonstrate some understanding of God's blessings in Scripture, but it could have gone further in illustrating how these blessings are depicted throughout the Bible."
