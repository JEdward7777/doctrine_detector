## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 Absolutely! In the Book of Genesis, one of the most notable examples is the blessing that God bestowed upon the first human beings, Adam and Eve, after their creation in the Garden of Eden. After creating them, God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good (Genesis 1:31). This indicates a divine blessing upon His creation, and sets a precedent for God's continued care and blessings throughout the Bible.

In another example, in Genesis 24:60, we read about Rebekah, who was blessed by both her family and Isaac, and later became the wife of Isaac and the mother of Jacob and Esau. Again, this blessing serves as a manifestation of God's favor upon His chosen ones.

These examples demonstrate that God's blessings extend to all aspects of creation, including humans, as He values each part of His creation and desires its well-being.
