## Question [Biblical Examples of Innocence](../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md)
Can you provide examples from Scripture that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers?

Examples include Jesus being recognized as 'innocent' by the soldier guarding him (Luke 23:47) and the acknowledgment by the other criminal during the crucifixion that he was guilty while Jesus was not.

## Concern to grade by
These examples serve to elucidate key moments in the New Testament that affirm the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations.

## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 Absolutely! Here are a few examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of innocence, particularly in relation to Jesus and His accusers:

1. Jesus's Birth and Presentation (Luke 2:1-38)
- Jesus was born through a miraculous conception, making Him pure and innocent from the start. He was wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn. Later, Simeon and Anna, holy individuals, recognized Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah when they saw Him in the Temple.

2. Temptation of Jesus (Matthew 4:1-11)
- After being led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil, Jesus resisted each test with the words, "It is written." This demonstrates His innocence and obedience to God's word.

3. The Trial of Jesus (Matthew 26:59-64)
- During His trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus remained silent when asked if He was the Messiah, saying it was better that such matters be judged by His Father in heaven. This shows His innocence and trust in God's justice.

4. Pilate's Judgment (John 18:36-37)
- When Pontius Pilate asked Jesus if He was a king, Jesus replied, "You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me." This response further highlights Jesus's innocence and commitment to truth.

5. The Innocent Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53:4-7)
- This prophecy in Isaiah speaks about the Suffering Servant, who would be despised and rejected by mankind, pierced for their transgressions, and crushed for their iniquities. This passage ultimately points to Jesus, showing that even though He was innocent, He would suffer and die for the sins of humanity.

These examples demonstrate the theme of innocence in the Bible, particularly concerning Jesus and His accusers. They show Jesus's pure character, obedience to God, trust in divine justice, commitment to truth, and ultimate sacrifice for humanity.
