The references to Jesus's birth, temptation, trial, Pilate's judgment, and the suffering servant prophecy are all relevant and well-explained. The student effectively ties these examples together to show Jesus's purity, obedience, trust in God, commitment to truth, and sacrificial nature. However, a bit more depth or insight into the theological significance of Jesus's innocence and its implications for salvation could have further enhanced the response."
