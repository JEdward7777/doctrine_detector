  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer with relevant examples from Scripture that demonstrate the concept of innocence, particularly in relation to Jesus and His accusers. However, the answer could have been improved by including the specific examples provided in the reference answer, such as the recognition of Jesus as 'innocent' by the soldier guarding him in Luke 23:47 and the acknowledgment of Jesus's innocence by one of the criminals during the crucifixion. Integrating these specific examples would have strengthened the student's response and provided a more comprehensive examination of the theme of innocence in the New Testament."
