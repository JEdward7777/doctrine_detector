The examples given from the New Testament effectively affirm the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations. The biblical passages referenced are relevant and demonstrate a deep understanding of the theme of innocence in Christian theology. This response aligns well with a Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern raised. Great job!"
