  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer identifying three Biblical figures who expressed lament and drawing valuable lessons from their examples. While the response was thorough and well-explained, it could have been more concise and focused on the specific concern of how biblical lament can support personal growth and deepen one's relationship with God. Nevertheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview."
