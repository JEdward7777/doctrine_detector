  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90. The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported list of key examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of mercy, supported by relevant scriptures and explanations. The examples chosen cover a variety of situations and characters, effectively enhancing the understanding of mercy through scriptural references and real-life applications. The inclusion of both Old and New Testament stories further enriches the response. Overall, a strong demonstration of exploring mercy through Biblical narratives."
