The examples are well-explained and supported with relevant scripture references. Additionally, the response effectively integrates the teachings of Jesus and the Old Testament to emphasize the importance of extending mercy in our interactions with others. The use of biblical stories like The Prodigal Son, Zacchaeus, and The Good Samaritan showcases the depth of God's mercy and the call to emulate this in our own lives. The response effectively addresses the concern by providing a rich analysis of mercy through scriptural references and real-life applications."
