  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided detailed examples from the Bible that illustrate the power and importance of prayer, which aligns well with the concern of learning to foster a stronger prayer life from biblical stories. However, the student missed including some key examples like Isaac praying for Rebekah's fertility, Moses praying for the people, and Jesus instructing His disciples to pray to avoid temptation as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Encouraging the student to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant examples in future responses."
