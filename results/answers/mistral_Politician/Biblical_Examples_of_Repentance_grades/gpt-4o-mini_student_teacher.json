  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful response, citing relevant examples from the Bible that demonstrate the act of repentance. The examples chosen effectively illustrate the concept of repentance and its importance in the Christian faith. However, the grade is slightly lower due to not aligning precisely with the reference answer provided by the teacher, as additional examples could have been included to match it more closely."
