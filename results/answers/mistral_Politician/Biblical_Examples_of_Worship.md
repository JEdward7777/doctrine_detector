## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 Absolutely! In the Book of Exodus, there's a clear contrast between true worship (of God) and idol worship. The story is found in Exodus 32, which describes how Moses was up on Mount Sinai receiving the Ten Commandments from God, and the Israelites grew impatient. They requested Aaron, Moses' brother, to create an idol for them to worship:

"Then they said to Aaron, 'Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we donâ€™t know what happened to him.'
Aaron answered them, 'Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.' So all the people took off their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron. He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, 'These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.'" (Exodus 32:1-4)

This story illustrates a contrast between worshipping the true God who led them out of slavery in Egypt and creating idols to replace Him. This is a common theme throughout the Old Testament as the Israelites frequently fell into the trap of idolatry, which was strictly forbidden by God.
