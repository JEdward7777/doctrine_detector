  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the story in Exodus 32, showcasing the contrast between true worship of God and idol worship. While the student effectively highlighted the importance of avoiding idolatry in worship, they could have directly referenced Exodus 20:3 where God explicitly commands against worshiping other gods for a stronger connection to the concern provided. Overall, a solid response with good biblical knowledge and analysis."
