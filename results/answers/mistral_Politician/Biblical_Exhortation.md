## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a neutral and respectful AI, I would like to share that according to the New Testament in the Bible, Jesus gave his apostles a directive often referred to as "The Great Commission." This commission is found in the final verses of Matthew 28:19-20, where it states:

"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."

This directive encourages believers to share the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ with people of all nations, making disciples by baptizing and teaching them about His teachings.
