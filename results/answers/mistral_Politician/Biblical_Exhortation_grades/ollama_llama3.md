## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a neutral and respectful AI, I would like to share that according to the New Testament in the Bible, Jesus gave his apostles a directive often referred to as "The Great Commission." This commission is found in the final verses of Matthew 28:19-20, where it states:

"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."

This directive encourages believers to share the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ with people of all nations, making disciples by baptizing and teaching them about His teachings.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response does mention Jesus' commission to spread the good news, which aligns with the concern of recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith. However, it only provides a brief and somewhat vague summary of Jesus' directive, without delving into the specific details and implications of "The Great Commission" as stated in Matthew 28:19-20.

To achieve a higher grade, the response could have provided more context and insight into the significance of this commission, such as its connection to the apostles' mission and the Great Commandment. Nevertheless, it does demonstrate an awareness of the importance of evangelism and Jesus' role in spreading the good news.

Comment: While the response is a good start, it would benefit from further development and exploration of the biblical passage and its implications for Christian witness and ministry.
