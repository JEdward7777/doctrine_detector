## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician, it's essential to approach such questions with sensitivity and inclusivity while maintaining historical accuracy. The title "King of the Jews" in the New Testament has significant connections to Old Testament prophecies, which were believed by many Jews and Christians to be fulfilled through Jesus.

The prophetic references can be traced back to passages such as Isaiah 9:6-7, where God is described as a "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace" and also promises a "King who will reign forever" on David's throne. Additionally, Daniel 7:13-14 describes a figure who comes with the clouds of heaven to receive an eternal kingship from God.

In Matthew 2:2, we see that Herod the Great was told by the Magi about the birth of a new king of the Jews, leading him to inquire about the exact location of the child, as he was troubled and "all Jerusalem with him." This reference underscores the anticipation among certain sectors of Jewish society for a Messianic figure who would restore Israel's sovereignty, bring peace, and fulfill other promises of the Old Testament prophecies.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge that interpretations of these prophetic texts may vary widely across different religious groups, and some may not see Jesus as the fulfillment of these prophecies. It is essential always to approach such discussions with respect for diversity and inclusivity, recognizing the richness and complexity of various religious traditions and beliefs.
