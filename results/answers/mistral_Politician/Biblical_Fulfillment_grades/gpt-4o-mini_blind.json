However, the response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the doctrinal significance of Jesus as the fulfillment of these prophecies within Christian belief. Additionally, there was a missed opportunity to articulate the unique Christian perspective on Jesus as the ultimate King of the Jews in fulfillment of God's promises. The closing remarks on diversity and inclusivity, while important in a general context, could be improved by offering a more robust defense of the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Messiah in light of Old Testament prophecies."
