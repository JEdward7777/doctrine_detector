However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the central theme of the Messiah from David's line establishing an everlasting kingdom, as highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, the response could have further emphasized the significance of recognizing Jesus as the fulfillment of these prophecies in Christian theology. Overall, a solid effort with room for refinement."
