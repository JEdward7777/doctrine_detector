  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate response by citing relevant Bible verses that clearly illustrate the concept of God's majesty. The examples chosen effectively showcase God's power, wisdom, and sovereignty in a doctrinally sound manner. However, the closing statement about being mindful of not offending others is slightly unnecessary in the context of discussing God's attributes as described in the Bible, as doctrinal correctness should be the primary focus when discussing theological concepts such as God's majesty. Overall, a well-constructed and informative answer."
