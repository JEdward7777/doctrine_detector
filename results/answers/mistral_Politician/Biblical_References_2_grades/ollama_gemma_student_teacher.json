  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of God's majesty and provides relevant biblical references to support their claims. They clearly articulate the attributes of God that contribute to His majestic nature, such as His infinite power, wisdom, and eternal existence. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration and engagement with the specified concern of connecting scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature. Additionally, including more direct connections to the provided reference answer would enhance the overall coherence and completeness of the response."
