  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides some relevant Bible references, but they do not directly illustrate God's majestic nature as specified in the concern. While Daniel 4:36 does mention God's majesty, the other references listed are not specifically focused on this concept. To fully address the concern of connecting scripture with an understanding of God's majestic nature, the response should have included more direct and explicit Bible verses that highlight God's power, wisdom, and eternal nature, as seen in the provided examples from Isaiah, Psalm, Daniel, and Job.\n\nTo improve the grade, the response could provide more scriptural support for the concept of God's majesty, such as references to His creative power, sovereignty, or attributes like omnipotence and omniscience."
