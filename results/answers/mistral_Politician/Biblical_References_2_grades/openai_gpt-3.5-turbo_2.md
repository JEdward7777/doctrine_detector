Verse 26 states, "Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; because of his great power and strength, not one of them is missing."

2. Psalm 93:1-5: This psalm describes God as enthroned on the cherubim, praising Him for His greatness and majesty. Verse 4 says, "Mighty King, loved by all the earth, you establish mountains in their places; you provide food for the wild animals."

3. Daniel 4:34-35: In this passage, Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges God's majesty after experiencing His judgment and restoration. Verse 35 says, "All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: 'What have you done?'"

4. Job 38-41: These chapters depict God's majesty through His creation, reminding Job of His power and wisdom. In these passages, God questions Job about the mysteries of nature, such as the sea creatures and the constellations, to remind him of His infinite knowledge and power.
