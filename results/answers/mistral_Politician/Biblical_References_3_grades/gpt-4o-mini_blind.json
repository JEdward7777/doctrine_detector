However, the approach of prioritizing political correctness and widely accepted beliefs over presenting a clear Christian perspective on the topic detracts from the doctrinal correctness. The answer would benefit from a stronger emphasis on the fulfillment of these prophecies in Jesus Christ as taught in Christian theology."
