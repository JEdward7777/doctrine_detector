  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the Old Testament references to the \"Son of Man\" and its connection to Jesus' messianic role. The author provides specific examples from Daniel, Ezekiel, and Psalms, which is in line with the concern to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' role as the Son of Man.\n\nThe response also acknowledges the diversity of beliefs and traditions within various religious communities, showing sensitivity to different interpretations. However, there are a few areas where the response could improve:\n\n* The response does not explicitly connect the Old Testament references to Jesus' messianic role in the New Testament, which is the main concern. While it mentions Matthew 26:64, this connection is not fully developed.\n* The response could benefit from more analysis and interpretation of the Old Testament passages themselves, rather than simply summarizing their content.\n\nOverall, this is a solid response that demonstrates a good understanding of the Old Testament context and its relevance to Jesus' messianic role. With some additional development and analysis, it could be even stronger."
