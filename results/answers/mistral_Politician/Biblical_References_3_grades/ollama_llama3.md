## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politically correct figure, I would prefer to focus on the interpretations and beliefs that have been widely accepted by various religious communities rather than making personal assumptions or conclusions. The term "Son of Man" appears frequently in the Old Testament (also known as the Hebrew Bible), primarily in the Book of Daniel, but also in other books like Ezekiel and Psalms.

In Daniel 7:13-14, the prophet describes a vision where "one like a Son of Man" comes with the clouds of heaven, is given authority, glory, and sovereign power by God over all nations, and judgement is given to him concerning many people and many tough issues. This passage is often interpreted by Christians as a foreshadowing or prophecy of Jesus Christ, who claimed to be the Son of Man (see Matthew 26:64).

In Ezekiel 2:1-5 and Ezekiel 3:1-9, God calls the prophet Ezekiel "Son of Man" multiple times. Some Christians see a parallel between Ezekiel's role as a messenger from God to his people and Jesus Christ's role as the Messiah who brings God's message to humanity.

In Psalm 8:4, the psalmist prays, "What is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?" The term used for "man" in Hebrew is "ben adam," which can be translated as "son of man." Some interpretations see this phrase as a way of emphasizing the humility and vulnerability of humans before God.

These Old Testament references contribute to the understanding of the "Son of Man" as a figure who represents humanity, God's care for humans, and the coming Messiah in Christian eschatology. It is essential to approach these interpretations with sensitivity, recognizing the diverse beliefs and traditions within various religious communities.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of the Old Testament references to the "Son of Man" and its connection to Jesus' messianic role. The author provides specific examples from Daniel, Ezekiel, and Psalms, which is in line with the concern to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' role as the Son of Man.

The response also acknowledges the diversity of beliefs and traditions within various religious communities, showing sensitivity to different interpretations. However, there are a few areas where the response could improve:

* The response does not explicitly connect the Old Testament references to Jesus' messianic role in the New Testament, which is the main concern. While it mentions Matthew 26:64, this connection is not fully developed.
* The response could benefit from more analysis and interpretation of the Old Testament passages themselves, rather than simply summarizing their content.

Overall, this is a solid response that demonstrates a good understanding of the Old Testament context and its relevance to Jesus' messianic role. With some additional development and analysis, it could be even stronger.
