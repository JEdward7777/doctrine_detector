  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough analysis of the Old Testament references to the \"Son of Man\" and effectively connects them to Jesus' messianic role in the New Testament. The explanation is well-supported with relevant scripture passages and shows a clear understanding of how the Old Testament informs the Christian understanding of Jesus as the \"Son of Man.\" The response could have further elaborated on the significance of these connections for Christian theology, but overall, it demonstrates strong knowledge and critical thinking in addressing the concern presented."
