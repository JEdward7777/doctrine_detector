The integration of key scriptures from Daniel and Ezekiel, along with the discussion on the parallel between Ezekiel's role and Jesus's messianic identity, demonstrates a solid understanding of how the Old Testament informs the New Testament view of Jesus as the \"Son of Man.\" The response effectively addresses the concern raised with a strong biblical foundation. Great job!"
