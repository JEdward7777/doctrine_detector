The discussion is thorough and insightful, demonstrating a strong understanding of how the Old Testament informs Christian beliefs about Jesus as the 'Son of Man.' The response could have been strengthened by incorporating additional New Testament references or theological reflections on the significance of Jesus' identification as the 'Son of Man', but overall it is well-reasoned and supported."
