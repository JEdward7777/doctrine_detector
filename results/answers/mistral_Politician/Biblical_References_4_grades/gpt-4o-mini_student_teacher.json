  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided relevant biblical passages where 'Lord' is used to refer to God and explained the significance of acknowledging God's authority, their examples were slightly different from the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's response was comprehensive and demonstrated a good understanding of the concept, but it would have been improved by aligning more closely with the specific references outlined by the teacher. Overall, the student showed a strong grasp of the topic."
