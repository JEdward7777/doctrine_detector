  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides some excellent biblical examples to illustrate the use of \"Lord\" as a reference to God's authority, divinity, and reverence. The examples from Exodus, Psalm, Matthew, and Romans are all relevant and well-chosen to demonstrate how people express awe, reverence, and obedience towards God in different contexts. However, while these examples do show the importance of acknowledging Jesus as Lord, they could be more explicitly connected to the concern about recognizing biblical references that reinforce understanding of God's authority.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, it would be beneficial to explicitly highlight how each example reinforces our understanding of God's authority and why it is essential to acknowledge Him as Lord. Additionally, providing more examples or exploring different contexts where \"Lord\" is used could further strengthen the response and demonstrate a deeper understanding of this concern."
