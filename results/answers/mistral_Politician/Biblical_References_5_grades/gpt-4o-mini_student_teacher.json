  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 75.\n\nWhile the student accurately identified 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 as the scripture connecting unleavened bread to Christian teachings, they misinterpreted the specific context of the passage. The teacher's reference answer highlights that the focus is on removing sin from the church and relating it to Christian life and purity, rather than solely focusing on Christ's sacrifice. The student could have provided a more precise explanation of how the concept of unleavened bread in 1 Corinthians relates to Christian practices specifically around purification and holiness."
