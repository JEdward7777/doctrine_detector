  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is well-written and clearly explains the connection between the concept of unleavened bread and Christian teachings in 1 Corinthians 5:7-8. They correctly identify the passage as referencing the Jewish tradition of eating unleavened bread during the Passover festival and draw a symbolic connection to Christ's sacrifice and the removal of sin from believers' lives. However, the student could have elaborated more on the significance of this connection in Christian theology or provided additional supporting scriptures."
