It effectively explains the connection between unleavened bread and the removal of sin from the church, showing a good understanding of the passage in relation to Christian practices. The response could have further elaborated on how the symbolism of unleavened bread in the Passover tradition is carried over to Christian teachings, but overall, it demonstrates a solid grasp of the biblical connection."
