## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a neutral AI, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations, but I can certainly help you find Bible verses that discuss the concept of resurrection. Here are a few examples from the New Testament:

1. John 5:28-29 (NIV): "Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out—those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned."

2. 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 (NIV): "For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures."

3. Matthew 27:52-53 (NIV): "And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and coming out of the graves after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many."

4. Acts 24:15 (NIV): "I have hope in God—a hope that has its fulfillment with Christ—that there is a resurrection of the dead."

These verses discuss the idea of resurrection, which is a central theme in Christianity. It's important to remember that interpretations may vary among different religious groups and individuals.
