  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good selection of Bible verses that discuss the concept of resurrection, which aligns with the concern of grounding beliefs in authoritative Christian texts. However, the student missed some key verses mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Encouraging the student to include those verses would strengthen their response and alignment with Christian teachings."
