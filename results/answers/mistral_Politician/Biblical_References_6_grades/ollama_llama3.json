  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 90.\n\nThe LLM response provides relevant Bible verses that discuss the concept of resurrection, which aligns with the given answer. The inclusion of specific passages from the New Testament, such as John 5:28-29 and Matthew 27:52-53, demonstrates an understanding of the biblical narrative surrounding resurrection. Additionally, the response acknowledges the importance of scripture in grounding beliefs and teachings, which addresses the specified concern.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to provide a brief explanation or reflection on the significance of these verses, rather than simply listing them. A more in-depth analysis could help to strengthen the response and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the biblical text."
