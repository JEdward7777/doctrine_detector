The inclusion of New Testament verses like John 5:28-29 and 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian concept of resurrection. However, incorporating additional verses like 1 Peter 3:21 and Luke 20:27 as mentioned in the provided answer would have further strengthened the discussion."
