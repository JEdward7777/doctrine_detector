  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided appropriate Bible references that highlight the significance of the Sabbath, emphasizing the importance of resting, sanctification, and honoring God. The explanation is clear and aligns well with Christian teachings on the Sabbath. However, to improve, the student could have discussed further the theological significance of the Sabbath in Christian belief and practice."
