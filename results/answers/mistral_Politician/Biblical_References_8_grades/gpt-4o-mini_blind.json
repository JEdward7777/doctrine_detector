  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of Bible verses related to the concept of ransom and its connection to redemption. The student accurately references key verses from both the Old and New Testaments and effectively explains how these verses contribute to the understanding of redemption through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. The connection between ransom, payment, and redemption is clearly articulated. The only area for improvement would be to emphasize more explicitly the Christian understanding of Jesus as the ultimate ransom and mediator for all humanity, in line with Christian doctrine."
