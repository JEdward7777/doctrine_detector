The incorporation of specific verses such as Exodus 30:12-16, Mark 10:45, Matthew 20:28, and 1 Timothy 2:5-6 provides a solid biblical basis for understanding redemption through the lens of ransom and sacrifice. Additionally, the explanation of how Jesus' self-sacrifice serves as the ultimate means for redemption aligns well with Christian theology. Overall, this response demonstrates a thorough engagement with the biblical texts related to the theology of redemption."
