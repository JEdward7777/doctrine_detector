  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough selection of Bible verses that illustrate the concept of covenant faithfulness, highlighting God's faithfulness to His covenant and the expectation for humans to be faithful in return. The verses chosen effectively demonstrate the theme of covenant faithfulness. However, the student missed referencing the specific verses mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Integrating those verses would have strengthened the answer further. Overall, a strong understanding of covenant faithfulness is reflected in the chosen verses."
