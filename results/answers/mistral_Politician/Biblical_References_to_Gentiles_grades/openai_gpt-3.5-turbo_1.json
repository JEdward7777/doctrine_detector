However, it is important to emphasize the centrality of Jesus Christ as the only way to salvation, as stated in John 14:6, within discussions of faith and inclusion. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the theological nuances of grace and the role of faith in salvation, addressing how these concepts shape the Christian understanding of inclusivity."
