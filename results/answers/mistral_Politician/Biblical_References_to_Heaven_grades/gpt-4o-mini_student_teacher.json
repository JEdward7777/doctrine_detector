  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 75.\n\nWhile the student included relevant Bible verses that provide insight into the concept of heaven, their response could have been improved by including a broader range of verses that cover different aspects of heaven. Additionally, the student provided a concise explanation of the verses but could have delved deeper into the spiritual and physical realities associated with heaven as mentioned in the concern. Encouraging further exploration and analysis of these verses would enhance their understanding of God's kingdom and the complexities of heaven from a Christian worldview."
