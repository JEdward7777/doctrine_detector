1. John 14:2-3 (NIV): "In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am."

  2. Matthew 5:3 (NIV): "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

  3. Revelation 21:4 (NIV): "He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death' or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."

  4. John 3:16 (NIV): "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

  5. Philippians 3:20 (NIV): "But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,"

These verses provide insight into the concept of heaven as described in the Bible. They emphasize that heaven is a place prepared for believers, a realm where there is no more death, mourning, crying or pain, and it is our eternal home. It's important to note that interpretations may vary among different religious groups.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's response a 75.

While the student included relevant Bible verses that provide insight into the concept of heaven, their response could have been improved by including a broader range of verses that cover different aspects of heaven. Additionally, the student provided a concise explanation of the verses but could have delved deeper into the spiritual and physical realities associated with heaven as mentioned in the concern. Encouraging further exploration and analysis of these verses would enhance their understanding of God's kingdom and the complexities of heaven from a Christian worldview.
