  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a mixture of accurate information regarding the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) from both the Old Testament and the New Testament. However, their response lacked specific references to the books mentioned in the teacher's answer, which would have strengthened the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost. Additionally, the comment about politically correct and inclusive language was irrelevant to the academic content of the answer. Further emphasis on the designated books would have improved the grade."
