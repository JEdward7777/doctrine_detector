## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In your request, I am assuming that you would like to know the Bible verses where Jesus is explicitly referred to as the "cornerstone." Here are a few significant passages that fit this description:

1. Psalm 118:22 - "The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone." (This verse is often interpreted as a prophecy about Jesus in the New Testament.)

   This verse, when quoted in the New Testament (Matthew 21:42, Mark 12:10, Luke 20:17, Acts 4:11), is applied to Jesus. It suggests that though He was rejected by some, He is ultimately the foundation or cornerstone upon which our faith and salvation are built.

2. Isaiah 8:14 - "He will be as a sanctuary, but a stone for stumbling to both houses of Israel, as a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem." (This verse is quoted in Matthew 27:9)

   In this passage, Isaiah speaks prophetically about a child born to a virgin who will be named Immanuel. This child, Jesus, is described as a stone that some may stumble over or reject. The New Testament application of this verse, particularly in Matthew 27:9, highlights the fulfillment of this prophecy and emphasizes the importance and significance of Jesus as the cornerstone.

3. Ephesians 2:20 - "Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone."

   In this verse from Paul's letter to the Ephesians, Jesus is depicted as the essential cornerstone upon which the spiritual house (the church) is built. It underscores His importance in both the foundation and continued growth of our faith.

These verses illustrate Jesus' role as the cornerstone, emphasizing His significance, foundational importance, and ultimately, the bedrock of our faith in Him.
