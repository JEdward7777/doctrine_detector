  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response not only provides a thorough and accurate answer to the initial question but also delves deeper into the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone, drawing from various biblical passages. The writer successfully highlights Jesus' role in the foundation of faith and the Church, demonstrating a strong understanding of scripture.\n\nThe response aligns well with the concern about encouraging believers to explore scripture, as it provides a clear and concise explanation of Jesus' importance in our faith journey. The inclusion of scriptural references and thoughtful analysis further strengthens the response's connection to this concern.\n\nTo achieve a perfect score, the response could benefit from a more explicit discussion on how exploring these scriptures deepens one's understanding of Jesus' significance and ultimately, their faith. Nevertheless, the grade remains high due to the response's overall strength in providing accurate information, thoughtful analysis, and a clear connection to the initial question and concern."
