However, the answer could have been improved by including a more focused selection of verses directly addressing God's sovereignty and by providing deeper insights into His character attributes. It would have been beneficial to include explanations of why each verse specifically highlights God's sovereignty and how it reveals aspects of His character in relation to being the Most High."
