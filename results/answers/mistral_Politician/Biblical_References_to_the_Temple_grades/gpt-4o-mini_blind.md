 As a helpful and impartial AI, I don't hold personal beliefs or political affiliations. However, I can provide information based on various religious texts. In Judaism, the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) contains numerous references to the Temple as "Beit Yehovah" or "Beth El," which translates to the House of Yahweh or God's House.

For example, in the Book of Exodus (25:8), it states, "And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them." The term for sanctuary used here is מִשְׁכָן (Mishkan), which is often associated with the portable Tabernacle in the wilderness and later the Temple in Jerusalem.

Later on in Exodus (29:45-46), it says, "I will dwell among the children of Israel and be their God. And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them. I am the LORD their God."

Additionally, in the Book of Ezekiel (43:10-11), a prophetic vision about the future Temple includes, "And the glory of the LORD came into the temple through the gate facing toward the east... Thus says the Lord GOD: This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, for the LORD God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it is shut."
