  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer provides a thorough and accurate overview of the scriptures that specifically reference the temple as the 'house of Yahweh'. It includes relevant passages from the Books of Exodus and Ezekiel, and accurately translates the Hebrew terms for \"temple\" and \"house of Yahweh.\" However, it would benefit from including additional references from 1 Kings 8:44 and 2 Chronicles 6:4, as specified in the reference answer."
