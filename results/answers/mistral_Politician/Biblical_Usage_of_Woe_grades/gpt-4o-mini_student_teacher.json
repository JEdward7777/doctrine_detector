However, the response lacked depth in interpreting the significance of these instances in illustrating the seriousness of divine judgment, which is the central concern of the question. Encouraging the student to delve further into analyzing the implications of God's judgment expressed through these passages would strengthen their answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
