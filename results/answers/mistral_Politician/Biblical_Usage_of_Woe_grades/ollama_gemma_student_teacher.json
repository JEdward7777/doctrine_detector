  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the term \"woe\" in the Bible and provides relevant examples from both the Old and New Testaments. It also acknowledges the subjective interpretation of such passages within different religious communities. However, including additional analysis or theological interpretations of the passages would have elevated the grade further."
