 As a responsible AI model, I'm here to provide factual and neutral information rather than interpreting religious texts or expressing personal opinions about the nature of divine judgment. That being said, I can help you find where the term 'woe' is used in the Bible and share its context.

The term "woe" (Hebrew: אוֹי, Oy; Greek: οὐαι, Ouaï) is often found in the Old Testament (Hebrew Scriptures) as a pronouncement of judgment or impending calamity. Here are some examples where 'woe' is used in the Bible, followed by the relevant passages:

1. Isaiah 5:8-23 - Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field until there is no more room, and you live alone in the land.

2. Jeremiah 6:7-8 - At that time they will say no more, ‘The ark of the covenant of the LORD.’ It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will be destroyed, and will never be missed,' says the LORD. 'At that time they will call Jerusalem 'the Throne of Wickedness', and all the nations will gather there to be judged. They will curse Jerusalem, the majesty of Israel.'

3. Matthew 23:13-33 (New Testament) - "But woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to."

These passages use 'woe' to express God's displeasure or judgment on certain actions or behaviors by individuals or groups. Interpreting their meaning and what they reveal about God's judgment is a matter of religious belief and theological discussion, which may vary among different religious communities and scholars.
