## Question [Building Materials](../../questions/Building_Materials.md)
What materials were commonly used to construct altars during biblical times?

## Target answer from notes
Altars were often made from packed dirt or large stones. Some special altars were constructed from wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze.

## Concern to grade by
Knowing the materials and structure of altars can deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship.

## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the Bible, various materials were used to construct altars for religious rituals. Some of these materials include:

1. Stone: Unhewn stones or dressed stone slabs were often used in the construction of altars, such as the one built by Abraham (Genesis 12:7) and Moses (Exodus 20:25).

2. Earth: Altars made from earth were also mentioned in the Bible, like the one built by Noah after the flood (Genesis 8:20), and those built by Gideon (Judges 6:26) and Elijah (1 Kings 18:32).

3. Wood: Wooden altars were also used, such as the one Solomon built in the Temple (1 Kings 8:64) and the golden altar of incense mentioned in Exodus 30:1-2.

4. Bronze or Metal: The bronze altar in the Tabernacle was an example of this type (Exodus 38:1-7), as well as the altar used by Solomon (1 Kings 8:65).

It's important to note that different materials were used for different purposes and occasions throughout the Bible. It would be inappropriate or misleading to assume that a single material was universally used for altars during biblical times.
