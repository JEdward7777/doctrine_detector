  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer citing specific biblical examples of altars constructed from stone, earth, wood, and bronze/metal, which aligns well with the reference answer. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the materials commonly used for altars during biblical times. However, to improve the grade, the student could have linked the materials used to construct altars to the significance and symbolism associated with worship in Christianity, thus further deepening the understanding of biblical practices and reverence in worship."
