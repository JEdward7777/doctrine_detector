 As a neutral and objective entity, I don't hold personal beliefs or political positions. However, I can share information based on various religious texts and teachings. In the context of Christianity, one command given to believers regarding their personal sanctification is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:3 (NIV), which states, "For God did not call us to impurity but to holiness." This verse emphasizes the importance of pursuing a life of righteousness and moral excellence. It's essential to remember that interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations and individuals.

Comment: The answer correctly references a specific command regarding personal sanctification from 1 Thessalonians 4:3. However, the response could benefit from a clearer presentation without the assertion of neutrality and objectivity, as discussing Christian teachings can sometimes require a stance. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the biblical importance of holiness and sanctification in the life of a believer would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer.
