However, it could be improved by further developing the idea that believers have a crucial role to play in this process. The original response is correct in stating that God did not call us to impurity but to holiness, and it would be helpful to elaborate on what this looks like practically in terms of personal responsibility.\n\nThe original response also stops short of fully emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility by simply stating \"interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations and individuals.\" While it's true that interpretations can vary, a more comprehensive response would explore how believers can take ownership of their sanctification process and actively pursue holiness in their daily lives."
