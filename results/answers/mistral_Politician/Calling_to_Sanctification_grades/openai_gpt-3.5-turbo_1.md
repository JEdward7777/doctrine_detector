## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a neutral and objective entity, I don't hold personal beliefs or political positions. However, I can share information based on various religious texts and teachings. In the context of Christianity, one command given to believers regarding their personal sanctification is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:3 (NIV), which states, "For God did not call us to impurity but to holiness." This verse emphasizes the importance of pursuing a life of righteousness and moral excellence. It's essential to remember that interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations and individuals.

It aligns well with the concern of emphasizing personal responsibility in the sanctification process. The inclusion of the specific biblical verse from 1 Thessalonians further supports the argument. Well done!
