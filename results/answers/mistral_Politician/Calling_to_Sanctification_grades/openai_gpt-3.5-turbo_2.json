The reference to 1 Thessalonians 4:3 supports this point effectively. The concern about emphasizing personal responsibility in the sanctification process is well-addressed, highlighting the individual's role in pursuing righteousness. This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on sanctification."
