  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively ties in the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process by referencing the command for believers to sanctify themselves to God and be holy in everything they do. The provided biblical reference from 1 Thessalonians 4:3 aligns well with emphasizing personal responsibility in pursuing righteousness and moral excellence. The response could benefit from further elaboration on how believers are to actively participate in this sanctification process, but overall, it demonstrates a clear understanding of the concern raised."
