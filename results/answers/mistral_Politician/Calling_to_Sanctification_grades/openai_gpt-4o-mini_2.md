## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a neutral and objective entity, I don't hold personal beliefs or political positions. However, I can share information based on various religious texts and teachings. In the context of Christianity, one command given to believers regarding their personal sanctification is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:3 (NIV), which states, "For God did not call us to impurity but to holiness." This verse emphasizes the importance of pursuing a life of righteousness and moral excellence. It's essential to remember that interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations and individuals.

The provided biblical reference from 1 Thessalonians 4:3 aligns well with emphasizing personal responsibility in pursuing righteousness and moral excellence. The response could benefit from further elaboration on how believers are to actively participate in this sanctification process, but overall, it demonstrates a clear understanding of the concern raised.
