The answer focuses more on general themes of inclusivity and unity rather than emphasizing the specific theological implications of this event. The student correctly identifies the significance of the centurion's acknowledgment of Jesus' authority, but falls short in connecting this to the broader theological implications of the Gospel spreading to the Gentiles. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clearer Scriptural analysis and more specific references to Christian doctrine regarding salvation and God's plan for all nations."
