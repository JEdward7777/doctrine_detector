  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates an understanding of the centrality of inclusivity in the Gospel message. They effectively articulated the significance of the centurion's visit from Peter in expanding the Gospel beyond the Jewish community. However, there was a slight deviation in focus towards broader themes of unity and respect rather than solely emphasizing the opening of the Gospel to the Gentiles. Overall, a strong response with room for a more precise alignment with the concern provided."
