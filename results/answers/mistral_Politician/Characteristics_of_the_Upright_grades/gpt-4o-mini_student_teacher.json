  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed list of qualities that define an upright person in the biblical context. They referenced specific verses from the Book of Proverbs to support each quality, showcasing a strong understanding of biblical principles. However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the overarching theme of obedience to God's laws, moral purity, and living a God-pleasing life, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a deep knowledge of biblical virtues but could have focused more on the central message conveyed in the reference answer."
