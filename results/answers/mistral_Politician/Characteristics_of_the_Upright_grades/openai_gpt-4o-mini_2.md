 In the Biblical context, an "upright" or righteous person is one who follows God's commandments and leads a life that reflects moral integrity, honesty, compassion, and faithfulness. Here are some of the key qualities:

1. Fear (or reverence) of the Lord: Proverbs 9:10 states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding." This means having a deep respect and obedience for God's laws and commandments.

2. Integrity (or righteousness): Proverbs 10:9 says, "Whoever walks uprightly walks safely, But he who perverts his ways will fall at once." This implies honesty in words and deeds, fairness, and ethical behavior.

3. Wisdom: Proverbs 16:32 states, "He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, And he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city." This quality helps one make wise decisions and avoid rash actions.

4. Kindness and compassion: Proverbs 14:31 says, "He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God." This implies helping those in need and showing empathy towards others.

5. Justice: Proverbs 20:22 states, "The LORD makes poor and makes rich; He brings low and lifts up." This quality involves treating everyone fairly and equitably, regardless of their social status or position.

6. Faithfulness: Proverbs 20:6 says, "Many will plead with the LORD in vain; but it is he who will show them victory." This quality implies being loyal to God and keeping one's promises, as well as being steadfast in faith.

7. Humility: Proverbs 18:12 states, "Before destruction a manâ€™s heart is haughty, But humility comes before honor." This means recognizing one's limitations, being teachable, and not thinking too highly of oneself.

8. Purity: Proverbs 4:26-27 advises, "Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be secure. Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil." This quality involves abstaining from sin and living a life that is pleasing to God.

9. Self-control: Proverbs 25:28 states, "Whoever has no rule over his own spirit is like a city broken down, without walls." This implies being able to control one's emotions, actions, and passions.

10. Generosity: Proverbs 3:9-10 says, "Honor the LORD with your wealth, With the firstfruits of all your crops; Then your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine." This quality involves sharing one's resources with others and being generous towards those in need.

These qualities help create a life that is pleasing to God and reflect His character in our daily lives.
