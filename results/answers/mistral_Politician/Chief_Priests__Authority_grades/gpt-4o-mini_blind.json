  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the hierarchical relationship between the high priest, chief priests, and ordinary priests in ancient Judaism. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the roles and responsibilities of each group within the priesthood. The use of relevant historical and religious terminology enhances the response. An excellent job overall, with room for improvement in connecting the roles to the spiritual significance of the priesthood in Jewish religious practices."
