  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the relationship between the high priest, chief priests, and ordinary priests in ancient Judaism. They correctly highlighted the hierarchical structure of the priesthood, emphasizing the high authority of the high priest and the political power of the chief priests. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the religious leadership structure in ancient Israel. However, the student's answer could have been improved by explicitly stating that the high priest held the most authority over both the chief and ordinary priests, as indicated in the teacher's reference answer."
