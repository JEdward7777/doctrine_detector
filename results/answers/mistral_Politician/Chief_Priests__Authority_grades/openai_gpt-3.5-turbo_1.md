## [Answer](../Chief_Priests__Authority.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In ancient Judaism, during the Second Temple period, the high priest held the highest religious office, serving as a direct representative of God to the Israelite nation. The high priest was appointed from among the Aaronic lineage and was responsible for performing various ritual duties, including offering sacrifices in the Temple in Jerusalem.

The chief priests (also known as the Sadducees) were a specific group within the priesthood who held significant political power and influence. They served as the administrative officials of the Temple and were responsible for managing its affairs, overseeing daily activities, and coordinating with Roman authorities. Although they did not hold the same religious authority as the high priest, their political power and wealth made them influential figures in Jewish society.

Ordinary priests (also called Levites) belonged to the third and lower tier of the priesthood, ranking below both the high priest and the chief priests. Their primary responsibility was to assist the high priest and the chief priests in Temple rituals and services. They were responsible for maintaining the purity of the Temple and its vessels, as well as performing certain duties during religious festivals.

In summary, the relationship between the chief priests, the high priest, and ordinary priests can be seen as a hierarchical one, with the high priest holding the highest religious authority and the chief priests wielding significant political power. The ordinary priests occupied a lower rank, responsible for assisting in the religious rituals and maintaining the purity of the Temple.
