It correctly emphasizes the higher rank and authority of the chief priests over the ordinary priests, with the high priest holding the most authority. This analysis aligns well with a Christian worldview that values the significance of religious hierarchy as ordained by God for the proper functioning of worship and spiritual leadership."
