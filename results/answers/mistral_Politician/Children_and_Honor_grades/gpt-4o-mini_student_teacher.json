  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thorough answer citing relevant biblical references and explaining the importance of honoring parents in alignment with God's commandments. The inclusion of the exception regarding obeying parents in Acts 5:29 shows a good understanding of balancing familial obedience with obedience to God. The student effectively addressed the concern of clarifying the Biblical expectations for familial relationships. Great job!"
