  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provided a comprehensive list of modern practices that modern Christians can adopt to reflect the Old Testament concept of ritual cleanliness. The suggestions were thoughtful, considerate, and relevant to contemporary life. However, the answer could have been more focused on spiritual practices directly related to repentance, confession, and spiritual discipline as mentioned in the reference answer. The student showed good effort in considering different aspects of cleanliness but could have tied them back more directly to spiritual growth and accountability in a Christian context."
