The answer effectively explains how living in accordance with one's beliefs and principles, avoiding guilt and regret, and aligning with biblical teachings contribute to a clear conscience. The referencing of Acts 24:16 adds scriptural support to the explanation. However, to enhance the response, the student could deepen the theological significance of a clear conscience by highlighting the atoning work of Christ and the role of repentance in maintaining a clear conscience before God."
