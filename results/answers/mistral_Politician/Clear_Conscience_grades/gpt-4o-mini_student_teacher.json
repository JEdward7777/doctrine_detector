  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of what it means to have a \"clear conscience\" in the context of Christian teachings, touching on key aspects such as integrity, honesty, and moral righteousness. However, the student's answer could have placed more emphasis on the importance of confessing sins and seeking forgiveness from God for true spiritual health and alignment with God's will, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Emphasizing the crucial aspect of obedience to God and the significance of addressing sin in order to maintain a clear conscience would have further strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
