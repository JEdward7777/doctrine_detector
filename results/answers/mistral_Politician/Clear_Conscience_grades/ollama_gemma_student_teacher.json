  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the concept of a \"clear conscience\" within Christian teachings. It correctly emphasizes living in accordance with beliefs and principles, avoiding guilt, and maintaining integrity. The reference to the passage from Acts 24:16 reinforces the importance of aligning actions with faith and values. However, the answer could benefit from elaborating on the connection between a clear conscience and obedience to God, as suggested in the teacher's reference answer."
