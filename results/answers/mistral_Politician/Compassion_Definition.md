## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a neutral entity, I don't have personal beliefs or biases, but I can certainly share information about the concept of compassion in the Bible.

Compassion is often referred to as one of the fundamental attributes of God and is emphasized throughout the Bible. In Hebrew, the word for compassion is "rachamim" (רַחֲמִים), which encompasses mercy, lovingkindness, pity, and empathy.

One of the most well-known verses about compassion can be found in Matthew 25:37-40, where Jesus says, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me." This verse illustrates that showing compassion to others is equated with caring for God Himself.

Actions associated with being compassionate in the Bible include:
1. Helping those in need (Matthew 25:35-36)
2. Showing mercy and forgiveness to others (Micah 6:8, Matthew 18:21-35)
3. Caring for the widows, orphans, and foreigners in your community (Deuteronomy 14:29, James 1:27)
4. Visiting and caring for the sick (Matthew 25:36, James 5:14-15)
5. Standing up for justice and defending the oppressed (Psalm 82:3-4, Proverbs 31:8-9)
6. Showing kindness and love to others (Matthew 22:37-39, Galatians 5:13)
7. Offering words of comfort and encouragement (Isaiah 40:1-2, James 5:11-12)
8. Being willing to sacrifice your own needs for the sake of others (Philippians 2:3-4, Mark 10:45)
