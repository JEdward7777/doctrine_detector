  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed exploration of the concepts of 'restoration' and 'renewal' in a Christian context, drawing connections between personal and societal aspects. However, the response could be improved by focusing more on the transformative power of faith and God's ongoing work in a believer's life, as highlighted in the concern. The student effectively explains the concepts but could deepen the analysis by incorporating more specifically Christian perspectives on spiritual renewal and transformation in alignment with God's design."
