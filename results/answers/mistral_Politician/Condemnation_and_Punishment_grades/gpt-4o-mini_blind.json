  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student has provided a thoughtful analysis of the verses but their focus on a political perspective and a general sense of promoting understanding and harmony among diverse groups dilutes the specifically Christian understanding of the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22. The student correctly touches on human dignity, refraining from judgment, redemption, and righteous actions, which are relevant aspects of punishment in a Christian context. However, the student would benefit from diving deeper into the theological implications of these verses and connecting them more directly to Christian beliefs about sin, redemption, and the role of punishment in the context of God's justice and mercy. There is room for improvement in drawing out the implications of these teachings specifically within a Christian worldview."
