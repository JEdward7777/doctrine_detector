However, the student's answer did not fully address the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. The student could have delved deeper into how these teachings shape our perspective on punishment from a Christian worldview, emphasizing the balance between justice and mercy. Additionally, tying in the concept of God's ultimate protection and deliverance from condemnation as mentioned in the reference answer would have enhanced the response."
