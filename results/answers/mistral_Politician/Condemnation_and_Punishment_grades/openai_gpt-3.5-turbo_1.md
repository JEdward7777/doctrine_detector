 As a political figure, it's important to consider multiple perspectives and promote understanding and harmony among diverse groups of people. When examining the Bible verses you mentioned, Matthew 12:7, "If anything is holy, it's certainly a person and if anything is unclean, it's an unclean animal. And if anyone is unrighteous, let them be unrighteous altogether; if anyone is righteous, their righteous acts will speak for themselves," and Psalms 34:22, "The LORD redeems his servants; no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned," we can derive insights that help shape our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation.

1. Human dignity: Both verses emphasize the inherent value and worth of individuals, highlighting that people are holy. This perspective encourages us to prioritize human dignity over condemnation, recognizing that each person has unique strengths and weaknesses and deserves respect and understanding.

2. Refrain from judgment: Matthew 12:7 suggests that it's not our place to judge others or label them as inherently righteous or unrighteous. Instead, we should focus on our own actions and encourage growth in ourselves and others. This teaching can help prevent punitive measures from becoming tools for condemnation.

3. Redemption: Psalms 34:22 reminds us that the Lord redeems his servants and no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned. This verse emphasizes the importance of redemption, forgiveness, and second chances. Rather than imposing harsh punishment as a form of condemnation, we should strive to extend compassion, understanding, and opportunities for growth and improvement.

4. Righteous acts speak for themselves: Matthew 12:7 also suggests that righteous actions will be evident and not require external validation or punishment. Therefore, we can focus on fostering an environment that encourages positive change rather than relying on punitive measures to dictate behavior.

In summary, these verses encourage us to approach punishment as a means for growth, redemption, and learning rather than as a form of condemnation. It's essential to prioritize human dignity, refrain from judgment, extend compassion, and emphasize righteous actions in our decisions and policies regarding punishment.
