However, the response lacks doctrinal clarity. It fails to emphasize the foundational truth that salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ alone and the acknowledgment of His lordship is crucial to that belief. The student should focus more on the exclusive nature of salvation through Jesus and the necessity of confessing Him as Lord for one's salvation. Additionally, the student should avoid diluting the faith by suggesting that sensitivity and inclusivity should be prioritized over the truth of the Gospel message."
