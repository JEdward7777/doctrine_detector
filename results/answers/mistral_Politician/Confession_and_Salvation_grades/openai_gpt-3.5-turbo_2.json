  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately discusses the importance of confessing Jesus as Lord and believing in Him for salvation, referencing relevant biblical passages. The clarification provided on the theological implications of confession and belief is clear and aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the response could have further emphasized the centrality of Jesus Christ as the only way to salvation in line with Christian doctrine."
