The references to verses in the Bible are appropriate and support the recommendations given. The emphasis on acknowledging temptation, prayer, fleeing from temptation, seeking wisdom, practicing righteousness, and confessing sin align well with Christian teachings. One suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the importance of relying on the power of the Holy Spirit to overcome temptation, as it is through Him that true victory is achieved. Overall, a commendable response."
