It appropriately highlights the importance of aligning one's conscience with God's will through biblical teachings, prayer, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The mention of being cautious about personal biases and cultural influences on conscience is a good reminder. However, the response could have delved deeper into the concept of sin affecting the conscience and the need for repentance and forgiveness. Additionally, emphasizing the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate standard for conscience formation would have strengthened the answer."
