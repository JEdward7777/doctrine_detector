  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of individuals from the Bible who were consecrated to God, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, their answer focused more on detailing specific biblical figures rather than recognizing the significance of consecrated individuals in biblical history as a whole. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the spiritual and theological implications of consecration would enhance their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
