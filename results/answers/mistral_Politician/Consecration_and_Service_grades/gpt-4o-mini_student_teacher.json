  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of the significance and practices associated with consecration in various religious traditions. However, the response falls short in addressing the specific concern of understanding the purification process that comes with consecration. The student should have focused more on how consecration involves cleansing and making individuals or objects acceptable for service to God, as per the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's answer touches on the symbolic aspects of consecration but lacks depth in discussing the purification aspect."
