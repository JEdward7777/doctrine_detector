The avoidance of using the term \"evil\" and the emphasis on moral lessons rather than biblical truth weaken the response. A more robust explanation of the inherent nature of evil, sin, and its consequences according to Christian doctrine would have strengthened the answer. Additionally, emphasizing the need for repentance, redemption, and reliance on God's grace would have aligned better with a Christian worldview."
