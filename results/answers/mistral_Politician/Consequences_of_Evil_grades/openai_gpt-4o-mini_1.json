It aligns well with the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding these impacts in the context of biblical teachings. The approach of focusing on moral lessons rather than labeling actions as \"evil\" is respectful and inclusive, promoting understanding among individuals of different beliefs. The response effectively integrates Christian worldview principles in addressing the concern."
