  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the Biblical stance on pride and humility, citing relevant verses and emphasizing the importance of humility over pride. However, the language used is somewhat ambiguous and lacks a clear assertion of the authority of Scripture. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into the implications of these teachings for personal transformation and relationship with God. Overall, a decent effort but room for improvement in clarity and theological depth."
