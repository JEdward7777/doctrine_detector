  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the importance of humility over pride in Christian teachings, referencing relevant Bible verses.

The response could have delved deeper into how pride separates individuals from God's grace and how humility allows for a closer relationship with Him."
