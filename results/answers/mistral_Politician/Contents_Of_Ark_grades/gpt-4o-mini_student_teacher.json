  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate description of the items contained within the Ark of the Covenant based on the biblical account. However, their response failed to acknowledge the significance of the items as reminders of God's covenant with the Israelites. The emphasis on political correctness and sensitivity, while important, detracted from the core focus on understanding the covenant relationship between God and His people."
