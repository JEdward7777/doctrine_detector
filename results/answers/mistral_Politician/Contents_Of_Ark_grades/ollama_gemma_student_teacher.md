## [Answer](../Contents_Of_Ark.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politically correct and sensitive figure, it's important to respect diverse religious beliefs and avoid causing offense. The Ark of the Covenant is an iconic artifact from the Jewish faith, mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. According to Exodus 25:10-22, it contained three items:

1. Two Tablets of Stone: These tablets contained the Ten Commandments that were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai.

2. A golden pot or dish called the "Kaporet," which had cherubim engraved on its surface and was covered with a thick layer of gold. The Ark also had two more golden cherubim sculpted on its cover, facing each other.

3. Aaron's Rod: This was a rod that belonged to Aaron, the first High Priest of Israel. According to the biblical account, God made Aaron's rod bud and produce almonds as a sign of his ordination as high priest. The rod was placed inside the Ark as a symbol of the continuation of the priesthood.

To further clarify, this response is based on the account found in the Hebrew Bible, known to Jews as Tanakh or Mikra. To ensure I'm being respectful and inclusive, I always aim to use the most accurate and sensitive language possible when discussing religious texts and artifacts.
