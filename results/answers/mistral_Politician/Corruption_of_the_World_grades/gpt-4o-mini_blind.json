  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer a 70.\n\nThe student provides a well-thought-out response with practical suggestions on how Christians can identify corrupt influences in the world around them. They touch on important points such as using moral principles, biblical wisdom, community engagement, prayer, education, and setting an example of integrity. \n\nHowever, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the unique Christian worldview and the importance of discerning spiritual warfare as a factor in identifying corrupt influences. Additionally, the student could have included more specific references to scripture and how Christians should rely on the Holy Spirit for guidance in discerning good from evil. Overall, while the answer is comprehensive, it lacks a stronger emphasis on the foundational principles of the Christian faith in identifying corruption."
