 As a helper model, I don't have personal beliefs or affiliations. However, I can share information about the concepts you mentioned based on the extensive knowledge base I was trained on.

In the Bible, a covenant is a sacred agreement between God and people, or sometimes between people themselves. Covenants often include conditions that parties must fulfill to maintain the relationship. Here are some examples of both conditional and unconditional covenants:

1. Conditional Covenant (Old Testament):
   - Noahic Covenant (Genesis 9:8-17): God makes a promise not to destroy the earth by flood again, but this is conditioned on humanity's behavior, specifically their actions towards each other and the care of creation.
   - Mosaic Covenant (Exodus 19:5 â€“ 24:18): This covenant was made between God and the Israelites through Moses. The conditions included following God's laws, observing Sabbaths, and worshipping only Him.

2. Unconditional Covenant (Old Testament):
   - Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 15:7-21; 17:1-8): This covenant was made between God and Abram (later named Abraham). Despite Abram's age, lack of heirs, or any other conditions, God promised to make Abram the father of a great nation.
   - Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7:1-16; Psalm 89): This covenant was made with King David, promising that his kingdom would be established forever, and a descendant would always sit on the throne.

3. New Testament (New Covenant):
   - The Last Supper and Institution of the Eucharist (Matthew 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; Luke 22:14-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26): Jesus instituted a new covenant with His disciples, represented by the bread and wine, signifying His body and blood given for their salvation. This covenant is often considered unconditional, as salvation is available to all who accept it through faith in Jesus Christ.
