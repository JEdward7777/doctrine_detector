  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the biblical definition of a covenant, including key examples from the Bible. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of the binding nature and significance of covenants in biblical contexts, drawing a clearer connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher. Nevertheless, the student's understanding of biblical covenants is commendable."
