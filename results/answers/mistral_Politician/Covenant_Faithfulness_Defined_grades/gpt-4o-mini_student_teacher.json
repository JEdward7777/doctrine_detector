  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of covenant faithfulness in biblical relationships, emphasizing aspects such as loyalty, love, and obedience. However, the student could further strengthen their answer by explicitly connecting this concept to God's covenant with His people and the fulfillment of His promises, as emphasized in the reference answer. This deeper theological reflection would enhance the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective."
