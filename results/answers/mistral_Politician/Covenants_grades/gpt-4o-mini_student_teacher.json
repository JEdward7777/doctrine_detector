  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of biblical covenants and their significance in illustrating God's commitment to His people. However, the student's response, while informative and well-written, falls short of directly addressing the concern provided. The student spends significant portions of the response discussing inclusivity, understanding, and the role of a politician, which is not directly related to the concern of recognizing the continuity of God's promises throughout the Bible. A more focused discussion on the continuity and overarching narrative of God's promises in biblical covenants would have improved the answer."
