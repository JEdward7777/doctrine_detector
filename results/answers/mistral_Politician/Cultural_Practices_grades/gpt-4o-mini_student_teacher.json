The response demonstrates an understanding of the historical context and the evolution of attitudes towards Gentiles within Judaism and early Christianity. However, there is room for improvement in explicitly connecting the impact of Jewish views on Gentiles to early Christian practices as prompted by the concern. The response could have further emphasized the specific challenges faced by the early church due to these cultural norms and the subsequent discussions on inclusivity and acceptance within the Christian community."
