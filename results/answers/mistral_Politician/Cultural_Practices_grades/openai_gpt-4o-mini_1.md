## [Answer](../Cultural_Practices.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a political figure, I would like to approach this question with sensitivity and accuracy. It's important to note that the diversity within Judaism is vast, and generalizations can be misleading. However, certain beliefs and attitudes towards non-Jews (Gentiles) were common in ancient Judaism, particularly in sectors such as Pharisaism, which significantly influenced early Christianity.

One key aspect was the concept of "the Other." Gentiles were often considered as being outside of God's covenant with Israel and, therefore, not subject to Jewish laws. This distinction led to practices like dietary restrictions (kashrut), separation in worship, and laws about intermarriage.

However, when we examine the origins of Christianity, we find that Jesus and his early followers were Jews who were part of this cultural context. Yet, they challenged some of these traditional views. For instance, Jesus interacted with and showed compassion towards outcasts and Gentiles, which was seen as somewhat unorthodox in Jewish society at the time.

The Apostle Paul played a crucial role in shaping early Christian attitudes towards Gentiles. After his conversion, he advocated for the inclusion of Gentiles within the Christian community without requiring them to strictly adhere to Jewish law. This was a significant departure from traditional Jewish beliefs and practices, paving the way for Christianity to become a distinct religion separate from Judaism.

In essence, while certain attitudes towards Gentiles were common in ancient Judaism, early Christianity evolved to be more inclusive, emphasizing love and acceptance of all people regardless of their ethnic or cultural background.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a thorough and well-explained analysis of how cultural norms, specifically regarding attitudes towards Gentiles, influenced the early Christian community. It effectively demonstrates the evolution of inclusivity in Christianity compared to traditional Jewish practices. The integration of biblical figures like Jesus and Paul enriches the argument from a Christian worldview perspective. However, a slight deduction is made due to some generalizations about Judaism without fully acknowledging the complexities and diversity within the Jewish faith. Overall, the response effectively addresses the given concern from a Christian worldview.
