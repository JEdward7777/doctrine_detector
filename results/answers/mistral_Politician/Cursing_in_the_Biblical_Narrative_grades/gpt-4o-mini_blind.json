However, the answer could be improved by providing a more robust explanation rooted in Christian theology. It lacks depth in connecting the curse to the broader narrative of God's plan for redemption through Christ and the ultimate victory over sin and death. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the doctrinal implications of Genesis 3:14 would strengthen their understanding and analysis of the passage."
