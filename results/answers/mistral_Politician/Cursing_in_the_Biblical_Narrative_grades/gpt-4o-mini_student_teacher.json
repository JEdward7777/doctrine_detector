  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written response that recognizes the symbolism of the snake's curse in relation to temptation, sin, and redemption. However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on the broader theological implications of sin and the promise of redemption in scripture, as highlighted in the concern. The student could have delved deeper into how the curse on the snake foreshadows the need for redemption through Christ and the broader theological narrative of sin and redemption in the Bible."
