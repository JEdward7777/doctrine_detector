  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the theological implications of sin and redemption in the context of the curse on the snake in Genesis 3:14. The student accurately connects the curse to the broader theme of sin and the need for redemption through Christ. The response could have been strengthened by directly referencing how the curse on the snake in Genesis points towards the ultimate redemption through Christ, but overall the student effectively addresses the concern with a Christian worldview perspective."
