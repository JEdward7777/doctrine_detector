The student accurately references the concept's roots in prophecy and emphasizes the sovereignty and righteousness of God. The mention of varied interpretations and the call for sensitivity to diverse perspectives demonstrates awareness of differing views on this topic. Well done overall, with room for minor improvement in emphasizing the centrality of Jesus Christ in this eschatological event."
