  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-explained response on the significance of the 'day of the Lord' in the New Testament, mentioning aspects of God's intervention, judgment, and salvation. However, the student missed the specific Christian belief that the 'day of the Lord' refers to the return of Jesus for judgment at the end of time. A stronger emphasis on the Christian understanding of this term would have enhanced the answer."
