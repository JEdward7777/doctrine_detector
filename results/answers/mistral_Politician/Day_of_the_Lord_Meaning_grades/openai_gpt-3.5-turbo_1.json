The additional response delves into the significance and implications of this event for believers, emphasizing its importance in marking God's intervention, establishing His Kingdom, bringing justice, and fulfilling divine purposes. The understanding of the concept is solid and aligns well with Christian teachings. However, the response could further elaborate on how believers should prepare and respond in light of the 'day of the Lord.'"
