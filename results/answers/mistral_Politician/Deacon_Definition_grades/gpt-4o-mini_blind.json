  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a general overview of the role of a deacon in many Christian denominations, highlighting duties such as administration, charitable works, preaching, and support. However, it fails to explicitly mention the biblical basis for the office of deacon as outlined in the New Testament (1 Timothy 3:8-13) and the importance of serving with humility and diligence. Additionally, the emphasis on political correctness detracts from the clarity and doctrinal accuracy of the answer. A more robust explanation grounded in biblical principles would improve the grade."
