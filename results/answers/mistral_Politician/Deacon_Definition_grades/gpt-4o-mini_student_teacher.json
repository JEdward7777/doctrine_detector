  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer fails to address the concern of understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church. While they provide some general information about the role of a Deacon in various Christian denominations, they do not focus on the aspect of serving others in practical needs as highlighted in the reference answer. The student's response lacks a Christian-specific worldview and does not align with the concern provided."
