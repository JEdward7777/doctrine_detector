  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 75\n\n**Comment:** \nWhile the student's answer acknowledges the diverse interpretations of roles within Christianity, it fails to fully address the specific concern of understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church. While practical needs are important, the emphasis in the reference answer is on assisting with these needs as a primary responsibility of a deacon. The student's answer lacks clarity on other potential duties or responsibilities associated with the role of a deacon according to a Christian perspective."
