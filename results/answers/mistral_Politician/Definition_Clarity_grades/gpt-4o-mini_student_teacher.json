  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student accurately defines adultery in the Christian context according to Scripture by emphasizing the act of sexual intercourse between a married person and someone other than their spouse as a serious sin. They also mention the importance of love, forgiveness, and reconciliation within the Christian belief system. The student's response aligns well with the reference answer, but could have been improved by directly citing Leviticus 20:10 and Matthew 5:27-28 as specific references that define adultery, enhancing the biblical basis of their explanation."
