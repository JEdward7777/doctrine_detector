1. Mediate, Arbitrate, Facilitate, Advocate, Intervene, Negotiate, Liaise, Act as a Bridge, Step In, Take Action, Stand Between

Here are some examples of how these terms could be used in Scriptural context:

* Instead of "Now therefore, do not let my blood fall to the ground. See, this field that was bought with a silver coin, take it as a witness." (Genesis 38:25), one could say: "Now, therefore, please do not allow my death to go unavenged. Regard this field I have purchased as evidence of our agreement."
* Instead of "So Moses interceded for the people, and God relented..." (Exodus 32:14), one could say: "Moses stepped in on behalf of the people, and God agreed to reconsider their fate."
* Instead of "Then I will intercede for them with the LORD, so that they will not commit this wicked sin against me again" (Numbers 25:13), one could say: "I will act as a mediator between them and God, ensuring they do not repeat this terrible deed."
* Instead of "Then I saw another angel flying up from the east, with the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea: Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads." (Revelation 7:2-3), one could say: "I saw another messenger coming from the east, bearing the seal of divine life. He addressed the four angels who had authority to cause destruction: 'Hold back your actions until we have marked the followers of our God.'"
* Instead of "Then I heard a loud voice shouting across the heavens: 'It has come at last— salvation and power and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ.' For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down to earth." (Revelation 12:10-11), one could say: "I heard a great voice booming across the heavens, proclaiming, 'The time has arrived— redemption, might, and the dominion of our God, along with the authority of His anointed.' For the indictor of our kin, who constantly presents charges against them before our God, has been cast out from heaven to earth."
