  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a wide range of alternative translations for the term 'intercede' and has given detailed examples of how these terms could be used in different Scriptural contexts. The examples chosen align well with the concept of intercession in Scripture. The connections made between the alternative translations and the Scriptural passages are clear and demonstrate a good understanding of the term 'intercede' in a Christian context. Great effort overall."
