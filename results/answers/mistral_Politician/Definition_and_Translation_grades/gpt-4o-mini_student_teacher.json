  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as a 80.\n\nWhile the student did provide a variety of alternative translations for the term 'intercede' and demonstrated an understanding of how these terms could be used in Scriptural context, the examples given were not directly tied to the provided translations, which could have strengthened the overall answer. Additionally, some of the examples and translations provided may have slightly missed the nuance of 'intercede' as a term used in Scriptures. More precision in connecting the translations with the provided scriptures would have improved the answer. Overall, the student showed good effort and a grasp of the concept but could benefit from more precise application of the translations."
