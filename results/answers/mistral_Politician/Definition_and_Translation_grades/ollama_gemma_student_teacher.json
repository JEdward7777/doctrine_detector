They provide thoughtful and relevant examples that illustrate the diverse applications of intercession across different contexts. The clarity and eloquence of their explanations are commendable. However, some of their translations are slightly more formal or literary in nature, which may not be appropriate for all contexts. Overall, this is a well-written and insightful response that effectively addresses the concern for clarifying the meaning and application of intercession in Scripture."
