It also mentions the importance of accepting Jesus' sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. However, to further enhance the response, a deeper exploration of the significance of being a believer in Christ could be beneficial, such as discussing the concept of salvation, redemption, and the transformation that occurs in a believer's life through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit."
