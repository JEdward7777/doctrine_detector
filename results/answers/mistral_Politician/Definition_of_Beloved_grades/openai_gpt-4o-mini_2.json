It appropriately mentions the relationship between God and Jesus as an example of this term. The explanation aligns well with the concern regarding understanding the depth of God's love for Jesus and how it relates to believers. The only slight improvement would be to further elaborate on how believers are also considered beloved in the eyes of God in light of their relationship with Jesus."
