## [Answer](../Definition_of_Beloved.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In a biblical context, the term 'beloved' is often used to express affection, love, or favor towards an individual or group. It is used frequently in the New Testament letters, such as in the Gospels (Matthew 3:17, Mark 1:11, John 3:35) and in Paul's epistles (Ephesians 6:2-3). In these instances, it indicates a close relationship or deep affection between the speaker and the recipient. However, it is important to note that the original languages of the Bible (Hebrew and Greek) use different words for 'beloved', such as 'agapē' (meaning brotherly love) and 'philōs' (meaning friendship or affection), so the exact connotation may vary depending on the context.
