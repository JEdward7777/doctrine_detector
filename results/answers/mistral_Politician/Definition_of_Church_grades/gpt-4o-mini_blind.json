The explanation of \u03b5\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 and its significance in highlighting a community of believers called by God is accurate. The emphasis on the spiritual nature of the church as a gathering of believers, rather than just a physical building, is well articulated. Good job overall!"
