  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the New Testament concept of the church as a community of believers. It accurately describes the foundational elements of the church as a gathering of summoned people united through faith in Christ. The emphasis on the spiritual gathering rather than the physical building aligns with the concern stated. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the broader implications and significance of the church in the New Testament context."
