## [Answer](../Definition_of_Church.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the New Testament, the term "church" primarily refers to a community or assembly of believers in Jesus Christ. The Greek word used is εκκλησια (ekklesia), which translates literally to "the called-out ones," emphasizing the idea of a group of people who have been summoned by God and are united through their faith in Christ. The church serves as a place for worship, teaching, fellowship, and service. It is important to note that the term 'church' does not necessarily refer to a physical building, but rather to a spiritual gathering of believers.
