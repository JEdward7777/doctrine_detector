  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a well-articulated explanation of confession within a Christian context, referencing biblical teachings and emphasizing the importance of confession for repentance and spiritual growth. The student accurately highlights the personal nature of confession being between the individual and God. However, the student's inclusion of a broader political context for the term \"confession\" detracts from the primary focus on biblical understanding. To improve, the student could have delved deeper into the biblical context of confession without incorporating external viewpoints."
