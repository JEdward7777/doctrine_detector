## [Answer](../Definition_of_Evangelist.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 An evangelist, in its most fundamental sense, is a person who shares the Christian gospel message, often actively and enthusiastically. The term comes from the New Testament of the Bible, where it refers to those who were chosen by Christ to spread His teachings. However, the term has also been used more broadly to describe anyone who advocates for a cause or belief with great enthusiasm and dedication. It's important to note that while this term originates from Christianity, its use is not restricted to religious contexts in everyday language.
