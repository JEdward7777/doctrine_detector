  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately defines an evangelist as someone who shares the Christian gospel message, which aligns with the concern of understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel. The mention of the New Testament and Christ's teachings also shows an appreciation for the biblical roots of the term. Additionally, the recognition that the term is not limited to religious contexts adds depth to the response.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response does not directly address the literal meaning of \"evangelist\" as given in the provided answer. While it is implied that an evangelist shares the good news of the gospel, a more explicit connection between the two would strengthen the response. Nevertheless, the overall content and insight into the role of an evangelist earn this response a high grade."
