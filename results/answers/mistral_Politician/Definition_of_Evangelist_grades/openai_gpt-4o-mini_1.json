  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the literal meaning of 'evangelist' as 'someone who preaches the good news,' which aligns well with the concern of understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel. The additional information on the term's origins and broader usage adds depth to the response, showcasing a good understanding of the concept within a Christian worldview."
