## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a polite and considerate politician, I would like to clarify that the term "gospel" is derived from the Anglo-Saxon words 'god' (good) and 'spel' (news), which translates to "good news." In the context of the Christian Bible, the gospels are four books that recount the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. They are Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, offering unique perspectives on the life of Jesus. The term "gospel" in this sense refers to the core message or the fundamental truths of Christianity about the person and work of Jesus Christ as the savior.
