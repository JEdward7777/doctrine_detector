  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a clear and concise explanation of the literal meaning of \"gospel\" as \"good news\" and its significance in the Christian Bible. They accurately explain the connection between the term and the four gospel books, offering unique perspectives, and correctly identify the core message of Christianity. However, the response lacks deeper theological analysis or specific examples from scripture, which would elevate the grade further."
