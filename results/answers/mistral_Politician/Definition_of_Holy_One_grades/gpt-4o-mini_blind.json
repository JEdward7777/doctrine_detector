The student appropriately highlights the separation of God from the created world and His perfection. However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly highlighting the significance of God's holiness in the context of Christian theology, emphasizing the importance of holiness in understanding God's character and His call for believers to live holy lives. Additionally, the inclusion of specific biblical references or examples would have enriched the discussion."
