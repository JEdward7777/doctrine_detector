  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a solid understanding of the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible by emphasizing God's divine nature, purity, and sanctity. However, the grade is not higher as the student did not fully engage with the concern of understanding the holiness of God and His unique role in scripture. The response could have delved deeper into the significance of God's holiness and how it shapes His interactions with humanity."
