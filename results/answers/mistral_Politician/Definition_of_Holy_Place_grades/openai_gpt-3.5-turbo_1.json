The explanation aligns well with the concern of understanding the design and function of God's dwelling place from a Christian perspective. The inclusion of specific details such as the altar of incense and the bread of the presence helps to illustrate the importance of the 'holy place' within the larger context of religious practices and relationship with God. Great job overall, with strong alignment to the concern given."
