The explanation aligns well with the concern of understanding the design and function of God's dwelling place, highlighting the specific elements found in the Holy Place. The response could have further emphasized the Biblical foundations and spiritual significance of these sacred spaces within the context of God's relationship with His people, which would have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective."
