  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid understanding of repentance according to the Bible. The emphasis on a sincere change of heart, turning away from sinful behavior towards God, confession, contrition, and commitment to righteous living is in line with biblical teaching. However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning the necessity of repentance for salvation and the role of God's grace in the repentance process. Overall, a well-explained and mostly accurate explanation."
