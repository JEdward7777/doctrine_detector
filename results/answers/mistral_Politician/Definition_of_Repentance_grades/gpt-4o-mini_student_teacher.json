  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of repentance in the biblical sense, emphasizing the key aspects of genuine transformation and turning towards God. They correctly address the importance of confession, contrition, restitution, and commitment to righteous living. The mention of different interpretations in various religious traditions adds depth to the response. The answer aligns well with the biblical view of repentance, but could have been slightly more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
