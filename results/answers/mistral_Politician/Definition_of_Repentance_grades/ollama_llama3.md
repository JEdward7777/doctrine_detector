It is not merely an expression of regret, but a deep transformation that leads to a turning away from sinful behavior and towards God. The act of repentance often involves confession, contrition, and restitution, followed by a commitment to live according to righteous principles. It's important to note that the concept of repentance is central in many religious traditions and it can be interpreted differently depending on specific beliefs and practices.

The response provides a clear and biblical definition of repentance, highlighting its importance as a transformational process that involves a change of mind or heart regarding wrong actions, behaviors, or beliefs. The mention of confession, contrition, and restitution also adds depth to the explanation.

However, while the response touches on the importance of repentance in religious traditions, it could have explored this concept further, particularly with regards to its role in fostering genuine spiritual growth. Nonetheless, the emphasis on repentance as a turning away from sinful behavior and towards God aligns well with the concern about understanding the biblical definition.

Comment: To improve, consider elaborating on how repentance is essential for spiritual growth and perhaps providing examples of how this process can be applied in everyday life.
