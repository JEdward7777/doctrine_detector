It correctly highlights that saints are all believers in Jesus Christ who are set apart for God and strive to live according to His will. The emphasis on the sanctifying work of God and the distinction between being a saint and being infallible or perfect is commendable. The only improvement could be a deeper exploration of how the concept of saints in the New Testament relates to the broader teachings on salvation and sanctification."
