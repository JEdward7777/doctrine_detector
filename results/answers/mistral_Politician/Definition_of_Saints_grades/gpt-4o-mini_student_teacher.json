However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of the simplicity and conciseness of defining 'saints' as 'holy ones.' The response is well-written and demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept from a Christian worldview, but could benefit from being more succinct and directly aligned with the reference answer."
