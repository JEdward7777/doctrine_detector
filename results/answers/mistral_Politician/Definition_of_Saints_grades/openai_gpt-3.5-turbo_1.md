 In the context of the New Testament, the term "saints" refers to all believers in Jesus Christ, both collectively and individually. It is a title given to every person who has been made holy through faith in Jesus and His redemptive work on the cross. The use of this term underscores the idea that followers of Jesus are set apart for God and living according to His will, reflecting His character in their lives. The New Testament emphasizes that all believers share a common identity as saints, regardless of their backgrounds or individual characteristics. It is important to note that the use of the term "saint" does not imply infallibility or perfection, but rather refers to the sanctifying work of God in their lives as they strive to live according to His teachings and example.
