  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of sanctification according to the Christian worldview. They correctly emphasize the cooperative nature of sanctification between God and humanity, as well as the lifelong process it entails. Additionally, they effectively tie in the significance of sanctification in Old Testament contexts and its implications for believers. One area for improvement could be to further elaborate on how sanctification is related to justification and glorification within the broader framework of salvation. Overall, a well-written response."
