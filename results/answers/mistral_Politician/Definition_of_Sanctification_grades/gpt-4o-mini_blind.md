## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In Christian theology, the terms "sanctify" and "sanctified" refer to the process of being set apart for God's purpose, being made holy, or being cleansed from sin. This is often associated with salvation and personal transformation in the life of a believer.

In the Bible, sanctification is a work of God and a cooperative work between God and humanity. It is initiated by God through grace, and it is a lifelong process that involves obeying God's commands, resisting sin, and growing in faith and righteousness. In the Old Testament, the concept of sanctification is often connected to the holiness of the Tabernacle or Temple, where God's presence dwelled, and to the holiness of the priests who served there.

When a person is "sanctified," they are set apart for God's use, consecrated, and made holy. This is an important concept in Christian theology because it emphasizes the importance of pursuing a life that is pleasing to God and aligned with His will. It also highlights the transformation that occurs when a person comes into a relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student has provided a solid explanation of sanctification according to the Christian worldview. They correctly emphasize the cooperative nature of sanctification between God and humanity, as well as the lifelong process it entails. Additionally, they effectively tie in the significance of sanctification in Old Testament contexts and its implications for believers. One area for improvement could be to further elaborate on how sanctification is related to justification and glorification within the broader framework of salvation. Overall, a well-written response.
