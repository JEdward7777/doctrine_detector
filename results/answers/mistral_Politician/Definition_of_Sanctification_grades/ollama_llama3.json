  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good starting point for understanding the concept of sanctification, but it could be more comprehensive. The definition provided is correct, but it lacks depth and context. The response only touches on the idea that sanctification involves being made holy, without fully exploring its biblical significance or the process by which it occurs. To improve this grade, I would like to see a more detailed explanation of the concept, including its connections to salvation, personal transformation, and the role of God's grace in the process.\n\nThe response does not address the concern of understanding the biblical definition of sanctification, as it only provides a brief and somewhat superficial summary. To better address this concern, I would like to see a more thorough examination of scriptural passages that describe sanctification, such as Leviticus 11:44-45 or Hebrews 10:10-14, and how these passages relate to the concept."
