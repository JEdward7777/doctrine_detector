## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In Christian theology, the terms "sanctify" and "sanctified" refer to the process of being set apart for God's purpose, being made holy, or being cleansed from sin. This is often associated with salvation and personal transformation in the life of a believer.

In the Bible, sanctification is a work of God and a cooperative work between God and humanity. It is initiated by God through grace, and it is a lifelong process that involves obeying God's commands, resisting sin, and growing in faith and righteousness. In the Old Testament, the concept of sanctification is often connected to the holiness of the Tabernacle or Temple, where God's presence dwelled, and to the holiness of the priests who served there.

When a person is "sanctified," they are set apart for God's use, consecrated, and made holy. This is an important concept in Christian theology because it emphasizes the importance of pursuing a life that is pleasing to God and aligned with His will. It also highlights the transformation that occurs when a person comes into a relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ.
