  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the biblical definition of wisdom by emphasizing its connection to moral discernment, virtuous living, and the fear of the Lord. The inclusion of relevant biblical verses and the personification of wisdom as a woman from Proverbs adds depth to the explanation. However, the response could benefit from a clearer distinction between wisdom and knowledge/intelligence, as well as a deeper exploration of the implications of wisdom in relation to God's sovereignty and human decision-making. Additionally, referencing more scripture to support the points made would strengthen the argument. Overall, a good understanding of biblical wisdom is demonstrated in the response."
