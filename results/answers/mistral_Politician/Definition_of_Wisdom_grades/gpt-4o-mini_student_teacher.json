  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of biblical wisdom by referencing specific biblical passages and illustrating the qualities associated with wisdom, there was a slight deviation in focus from the core aspect of understanding what is right and moral according to God's will. The student did well to emphasize the importance of seeking knowledge to glorify God and promote righteousness, but could have tied back these points more explicitly to the concept of aligning decisions with God's will. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of wisdom in a biblical context and provided insightful perspectives on its practical implications. It's important to remember that clarity and coherence in connecting these ideas to the foundation of God's will would further enhance the response."
