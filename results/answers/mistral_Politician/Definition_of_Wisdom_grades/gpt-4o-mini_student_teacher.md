## [Answer](../Definition_of_Wisdom.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a helpful and informative assistant, I'd be happy to explain the biblical definition of wisdom! According to the Bible, wisdom is more than just intelligence or knowledge; it is a deep understanding of right and wrong, and the ability to live a virtuous and ethical life. In Proverbs 9:13, wisdom is described as "a woman who is brutal and is beyond reproach."

In the Bible, wisdom is often personified as a woman, representing the qualities of discernment, insight, and understanding (Proverbs 1:20-33). The wise person is one who fears the Lord, obeys His commands, and seeks to understand the nature of God and His creation.

In practical terms, wisdom in the biblical sense involves making sound judgments, avoiding foolishness, understanding consequences, seeking knowledge, and practicing righteousness (Proverbs 14:35). It emphasizes prudence, discretion, and the capacity to make decisions that lead to peace, prosperity, and a harmonious life.

To embody wisdom according to biblical standards means to cultivate these virtues in one's character and actions, seeking knowledge not just for personal gain, but also to glorify God, serve others, and promote justice and righteousness in the world.

80.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 80.

While the student provided a comprehensive explanation of biblical wisdom by referencing specific biblical passages and illustrating the qualities associated with wisdom, there was a slight deviation in focus from the core aspect of understanding what is right and moral according to God's will. The student did well to emphasize the importance of seeking knowledge to glorify God and promote righteousness, but could have tied back these points more explicitly to the concept of aligning decisions with God's will. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of wisdom in a biblical context and provided insightful perspectives on its practical implications. It's important to remember that clarity and coherence in connecting these ideas to the foundation of God's will would further enhance the response.
