  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of highlighting the biblical definition of wisdom, citing relevant scriptures from Proverbs, and explaining its importance in everyday life. It also emphasizes the character qualities that wisdom embodies, such as prudence, discretion, and righteousness.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples or illustrations of how wisdom plays out in practical decision-making situations. Additionally, while it mentions pleasing God as a key aspect of being wise, it could delve deeper into what this means in terms of aligning one's decisions with His will.\n\nThe concern about understanding the biblical concept of wisdom is well-addressed in the response, which highlights the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding that honors God. Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding biblical wisdom and its application to everyday life.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical concept of wisdom, but could benefit from more concrete examples and illustrations to help illustrate its practical application."
