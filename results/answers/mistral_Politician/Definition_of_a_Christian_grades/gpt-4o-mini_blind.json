  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a general overview of the term \"Christian\" but fails to clearly articulate the biblical definition. While the response highlights some key beliefs of Christians, it lacks doctrinal precision and depth. The emphasis on inclusivity and open-mindedness, while important in certain contexts, detracts from a clear biblical understanding of what defines a Christian according to Christian doctrine. The student could improve by focusing on presenting the biblical definition with greater clarity and emphasis on core doctrinal teachings."
