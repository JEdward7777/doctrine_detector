  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 70.\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the term \"Christian\" and showed awareness of the diversity of beliefs within the Christian faith. However, the answer deviated from the biblical definition by not explicitly mentioning the essential aspect of trusting Jesus as the Savior for personal salvation, as outlined in the reference answer. The response focused more on the general aspects of Christian belief rather than emphasizing the core biblical definition of a Christian."
