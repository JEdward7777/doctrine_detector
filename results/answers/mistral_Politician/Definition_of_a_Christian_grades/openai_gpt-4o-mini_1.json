The explanation touched on key aspects of Christian faith without deviating from the core tenets. However, there was some lack of depth in addressing the concern about understanding the true meaning of being a Christian according to biblical teachings. A more thorough examination of specific biblical passages or doctrines could have further strengthened the response."
