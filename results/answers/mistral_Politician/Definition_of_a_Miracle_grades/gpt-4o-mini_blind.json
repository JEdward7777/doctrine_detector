  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: While the student provides a general understanding of what a miracle is and how it relates to God's authority, the response lacks depth and specificity from a Christian worldview perspective. It does not emphasize the foundational role of miracles in confirming the authority of God as revealed in the Bible, nor does it address the unique significance of miracles in Christianity, such as the ministry of Jesus Christ. The response leans more towards a generic and inclusive viewpoint, rather than focusing on the doctrinal aspects of miracles within the Christian faith. Additional clarity and theological insight are needed to enhance the grade."
