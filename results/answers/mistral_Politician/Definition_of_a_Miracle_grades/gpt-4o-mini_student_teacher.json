  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a generally accurate definition of a miracle and touches on the concept of God's authority in relation to miracles. However, the response strays off-topic by shifting towards political correctness and sensitivity rather than focusing on the deepening of faith and acknowledgment of God's power, as specified in the concern. The student should have emphasized more on the divine aspect of miracles in a Christian worldview to align better with the given reference answer."
