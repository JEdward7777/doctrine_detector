While it acknowledges the role of divine intervention in miracles, it does not fully align with the given answer that specifies God's complete authority over the universe. The response could have delved deeper into the Christian perspective on miracles as a manifestation of God's power and sovereignty. Additionally, the sensitivity and inclusivity emphasized in the conclusion are commendable but could be further strengthened by recognizing the ultimate truth of God's authority in Christian belief."
