The mention of faith allowing others to join in this relationship is a good addition. The response correctly warns against using this concept for exclusion or discrimination. One improvement could be to further emphasize the spiritual significance of this chosen status and how it points towards God's redemptive plan for all nations through Jesus Christ."
