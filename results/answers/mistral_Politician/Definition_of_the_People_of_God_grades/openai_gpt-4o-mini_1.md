## [Answer](../Definition_of_the_People_of_God.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the Old Testament, the term "People of God" (or "Chosen People") primarily refers to the Israelites, specifically descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They were chosen by God to carry out a special purpose and covenant relationship with Him. This choice was not based on their inherent goodness or merit but rather on God's love and faithfulness. The term also includes other individuals and groups who, through faith, joined the Israelite community and shared in this divine relationship. It is important to note that this concept should not be used to justify exclusion, superiority, or discrimination against others. Rather, it highlights a unique historical and religious bond between God and His chosen people as recorded in the Old Testament scriptures.

It accurately conveys the essence of the covenant relationship established with Israel, focusing on their purpose to serve and obey God. The only slight improvement could be further elaboration on the specific terms and conditions of the covenant and how it impacted the relationship between God and the people of Israel.
