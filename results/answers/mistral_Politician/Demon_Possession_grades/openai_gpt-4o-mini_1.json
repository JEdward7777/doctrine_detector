However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the importance of understanding spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ. It would have been beneficial to elaborate on the role of faith, prayer, and seeking help through Jesus for deliverance from demonic influences. Overall, the response demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of demon possession in Christianity but lacked a deeper exploration of the spiritual warfare aspect."
