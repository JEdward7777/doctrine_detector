The examples given help to illustrate the nuances of each word effectively. However, from a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial to include references or examples from biblical context to show how these terms are used in Scripture. Additionally, connecting these terms to biblical principles of edification, correction, and accountability could further enhance the response. Overall, a solid explanation with room for deeper theological reflection."
