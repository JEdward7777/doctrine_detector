  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of the terms 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' with relevant examples, showing a good understanding of the differences in connotations. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it is important to highlight that 'admonish' not only implies warning or reprimanding for wrong behavior but also emphasizes the intention of correction with love and restoration in mind, as outlined in scriptures like Galatians 6:1 (\"Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.\"). Therefore, the student's answer could be enhanced by incorporating this aspect for a more holistic view based on biblical teachings."
