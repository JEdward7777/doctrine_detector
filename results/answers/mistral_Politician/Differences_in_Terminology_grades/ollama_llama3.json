  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise explanation of each word, including examples to illustrate their meanings. The writer effectively highlights the nuances between \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish,\" showing how they can be used in different contexts to convey varying levels of urgency, support, or correction.\n\nHowever, while the response does touch on the idea that \"exhort\" and \"encourage\" have more positive connotations, it could benefit from a more explicit connection to biblical principles. For example, the writer could have referenced scriptures like Ephesians 4:29 (\"Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths\") or Colossians 3:16-17 (\"Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly... And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do everything for the glory of God\") to illustrate the importance of using language wisely and constructively.\n\nAdditionally, while the response does acknowledge the seriousness of \"admonish,\" it could have delved deeper into the biblical understanding of correction and rebuke (e.g., 2 Corinthians 13:10; Galatians 6:1). Overall, however, this is a strong effort that demonstrates a good grasp of language and communication principles."
