## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician, I would like to emphasize that my interpretation of religious history is based on scholarly consensus and not personal beliefs. The selection of the Twelve Apostles by Jesus in Christian tradition is often considered significant due to their role in spreading the teachings of Jesus after his crucifixion and resurrection.

The choice of twelve apostles might have been inspired by the Israelite's twelve tribes, symbolizing the inclusion of all people of Israel in God's plan. It was also a practical decision for leading the community, as the number twelve is considered complete or perfect in many ancient cultures. The Twelve Apostles represented the new leadership of Jesus' movement and the continuation of his teachings among the early Christian communities.

It is essential to remember that understanding religious history involves respecting various interpretations and perspectives, aiming for mutual understanding and peaceful dialogue among different communities and beliefs.
