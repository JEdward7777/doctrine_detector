The answer would benefit from referencing Biblical passages or theological principles that explain the significance of the twelve apostles in relation to Jesus' ministry and message. Additionally, the student could have delved into the spiritual qualifications or specific roles that the apostles played in Jesus' mission rather than focusing solely on historical and cultural analogies. It is crucial for a Christian worldview to prioritize doctrinal correctness in explaining the selection of the Twelve Apostles."
