  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 60.\n\nWhile the student's answer shows an attempt to provide some context and understanding of the significance of the twelve apostles in Christian tradition, there are some concerns from a Christian worldview perspective. The student's response focuses more on a historical and cultural analysis rather than emphasizing the spiritual calling and specific role that the twelve apostles played in the New Testament. \n\nThe student does mention the spreading of Jesus' teachings after his resurrection, which is relevant, but the focus should have been more on the unique call and role that Jesus gave to the twelve apostles in establishing the foundation of the early Church. Additionally, the student's approach of distancing personal beliefs and relying on scholarly consensus, while valuable in academic settings, may not fully capture the profound spiritual significance of the apostles' selection from a Christian worldview perspective.\n\nOverall, the student's answer demonstrates some understanding but lacks a deeper engagement with the spiritual and theological aspects of the apostles' role in the New Testament."
