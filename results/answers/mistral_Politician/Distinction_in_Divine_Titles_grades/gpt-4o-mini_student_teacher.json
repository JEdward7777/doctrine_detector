However, the focus on feelings and beliefs of individuals, while valuable, does not directly address the concern of maintaining clarity in translations to prevent misinterpretations concerning God's identity and authority. The discussion on possibly offending individuals is important but somewhat misses the key point of avoiding confusion and misunderstanding in translations. More emphasis on the potential for confusion due to the double use of \"Lord\" in the translation would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
