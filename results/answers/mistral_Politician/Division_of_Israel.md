## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 After the reign of King Solomon, Israel experienced a series of ups and downs that include the division of the kingdom into two separate entities: the Kingdom of Israel in the North and the Kingdom of Judah in the South. The first major event was the death of King Solomon around 931 BC and the subsequent division of the kingdom under his son Rehoboam in approximately 930 BC. This period is also marked by the rule of other significant kings such as Jeroboam I, who established the Northern Kingdom with its capital at Shechem and later Tirzah and Samaria, and King David's grandson, Hezekiah, who ruled Judah during the 8th century BC. These events are crucial in understanding the political, social, and religious history of Israel.
