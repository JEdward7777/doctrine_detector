 In the Bible, Jesus Christ's dominion or kingdom is often described as one of love, peace, justice, and service. The New Testament frequently references the Kingdom of God or the Kingdom of Heaven. This kingdom is not a physical location, but rather a spiritual realm that is manifested through followers of Jesus living according to His teachings and principles.
