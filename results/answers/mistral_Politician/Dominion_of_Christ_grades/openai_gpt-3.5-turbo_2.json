  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response accurately acknowledges the authority of Christ as prophet, priest, and king, which aligns with Christian teachings. However, the response does not fully address how this authority impacts our faith in all aspects of life. It would be beneficial to elaborate more on the practical implications of recognizing Christ's authority in areas such as decision-making, relationships, and values."
