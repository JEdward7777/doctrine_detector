  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges Jesus Christ's dominion over all the earth, functioning as prophet, priest, and king, which is a fundamental aspect of recognizing His authority in all aspects of life. However, the response lacks depth in connecting this authority to impacting our faith. To improve the grade, the response could have elaborated on how acknowledging Christ's authority influences our beliefs, actions, and relationship with Him."
