 In the Bible, the term "last days" often refers to the time period encompassing the second coming of Christ and the subsequent end of the world. However, the specific duration or exact timeline is not explicitly stated in the text. This concept is more about spiritual understanding than a scientifically measurable period. It's important to remember that interpretations can vary widely among different religious groups and scholars.
