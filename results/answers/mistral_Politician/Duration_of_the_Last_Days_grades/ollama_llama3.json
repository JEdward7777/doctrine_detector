  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately states that the duration or exact timeline of \"the last days\" is not explicitly stated in the Bible, which aligns with the given answer (\"The duration of 'the last days' is unknown\"). It also correctly emphasizes that interpretations can vary widely among different religious groups and scholars.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response does not directly address the concern about how uncertainty can affect Christian living. While it mentions that \"spiritual understanding\" is more important than a scientifically measurable period, it could be further developed to explore the practical implications of this uncertainty for Christians.\n\nOverall, the response provides a clear and accurate summary of the biblical concept, but could benefit from further nuance and application to the concern at hand."
