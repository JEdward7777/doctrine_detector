The chosen verses align well with the question and cover a range of empowerment aspects such as spiritual gifts, guidance, witnessing abilities, and cultivation of virtues. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the deeper theological significance of the Holy Spirit's empowerment in the Christian faith, such as the role of the Spirit in sanctification and transformation. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the distinct roles and manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the Trinity would further enrich the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
