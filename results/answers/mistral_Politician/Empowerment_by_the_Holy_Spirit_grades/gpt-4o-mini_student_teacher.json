  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of Biblical references illustrating the empowerment of Christians by the Holy Spirit. However, the student's answer focused more on the manifestations and gifts of the Holy Spirit rather than on the fundamental ways in which the Holy Spirit empowers Christians as outlined in the reference answer. To improve the grade, the student should have emphasized more on leading, teaching, comforting, and enabling believers to proclaim the Gospel and live according to God's will."
