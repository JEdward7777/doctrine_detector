 As a neutral and objective AI, I don't hold personal beliefs or opinions. However, I can share the Biblical references that are often associated with the empowerment of Christians by the Holy Spirit:

1. Acts 1:8 - "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth." This verse suggests that the Holy Spirit equips believers with power for witnessing and spreading the message of Christianity.

2. Acts 2:4 - "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance." This event at Pentecost demonstrates that the Holy Spirit enables individuals to speak in different languages, a phenomenon interpreted by many as spiritual gift(s).

3. 1 Corinthians 12:7 - "To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good." This verse suggests that the Holy Spirit bestows various spiritual gifts on believers to contribute positively to the Christian community and beyond.

4. Galatians 5:22-23 - "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law." This passage describes the virtues that the Holy Spirit cultivates within believers.

5. Romans 8:14-17 - "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God...The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children." In this text, the Holy Spirit is presented as a guiding force and a source of assurance of salvation for believers.

These references illustrate how the Holy Spirit empowers Christians by providing them with gifts, guidance, witnessing abilities, and spiritual fruit. As always, interpretations may vary among individuals and religious communities.
