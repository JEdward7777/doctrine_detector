  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65/100\n\nComments: The student's response provides a thoughtful perspective on the importance of ethical integrity in leadership and the potential consequences of compromising values. However, the answer lacks a specific focus on the theological implications of the story of Gideon and the golden ephod in the context of idolatry and God's commandments. To improve the grade, the student should incorporate more scriptural references and theological insights to connect the story to Christian doctrine and teachings on idolatry."
