However, the primary concern in the reference answer is the importance of focusing on God and avoiding idolatry. The student's answer does not directly address this key aspect from a Christian worldview perspective. An improvement would be to tie the lesson learned from Gideon's creation of the gold ephod more explicitly to the dangers of idolatry and the need to prioritize true worship of God."
