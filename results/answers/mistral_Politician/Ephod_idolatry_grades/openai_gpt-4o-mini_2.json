The connection made between idolatry, ethical leadership, and the implications for political leaders is well-explained and relevant. However, the response could have delved deeper into the aspect of material representations of faith and how they can distract from true worship of God. More explicit references to the importance of focusing on God, as opposed to material symbols, would have strengthened the argument from a Christian worldview perspective."
