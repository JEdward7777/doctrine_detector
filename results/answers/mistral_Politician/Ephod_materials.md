## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a neutral AI, I don't have personal opinions or concerns, but I can share information on historical artifacts like the ephod. The High Priest's ephod, according to the Old Testament in the Bible (Exodus 28), was made from gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, fine twined linen, goats' hair, and turquoise, sapphire, and emerald stones. The gold was used for various ornamentations, while the other materials were used to construct the garment itself. The precious stones were inlaid in settings of gold filigree and were attached to the shoulder pieces of the ephod for engraving as a memorial. This information comes from historical accounts and religious texts, so it's essential to respect and consider the views and beliefs of those who hold these sources sacred.
