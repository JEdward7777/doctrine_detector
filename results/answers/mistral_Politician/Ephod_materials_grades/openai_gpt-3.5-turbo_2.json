It acknowledges the significance of these specific materials in highlighting the importance of the ephod's design and symbolism in worship from a Christian worldview perspective. The mention of respecting and considering the beliefs of those who hold these sources sacred further demonstrates an understanding of the religious context. However, a more explicit connection to the theological significance and symbolism of the ephod in Christian worship would have strengthened the response."
