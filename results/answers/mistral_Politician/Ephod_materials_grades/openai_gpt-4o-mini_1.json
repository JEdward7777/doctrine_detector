The acknowledgment of the significance of these specific materials aligns well with a Christian worldview, showing respect for the religious context and importance of the ephod. However, there could have been a stronger integration of a Christian perspective to emphasize the spiritual significance of the ephod in the context of Old Testament worship practices."
