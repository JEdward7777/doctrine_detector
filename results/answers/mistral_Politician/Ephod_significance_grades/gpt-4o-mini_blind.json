The answer focuses more on promoting inclusivity and historical appreciation rather than delving into the distinct purpose and symbolism of the ephod in facilitating communication with God and representing the priestly role. It lacks doctrinal depth and clarity in explaining the ephod's role as a mediator and conduit for seeking divine guidance. Additional theological insights and scriptural references would enhance the answer's effectiveness in addressing the question from a Christian worldview."
