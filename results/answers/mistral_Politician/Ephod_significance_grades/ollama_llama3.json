The description of the Ephod's components is also accurate.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more depth and context about the historical significance of the Ephod within Old Testament worship practices. While it touches on the idea that the Ephod symbolized a connection between the people and their God, a more explicit exploration of this concept would strengthen the argument.\n\nThe concern is also well-addressed as the response helps to clarify the role of the ephod in understanding Old Testament priesthood and worship practices."
