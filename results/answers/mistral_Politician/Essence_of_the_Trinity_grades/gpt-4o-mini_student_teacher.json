They correctly highlight the belief in the three persons sharing one essence. However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly stating that the three persons are co-equal and co-eternal, emphasizing their full deity. Additionally, the explanation could have been more assertive in affirming the unity of essence among the three persons, aligning with the reference answer."
