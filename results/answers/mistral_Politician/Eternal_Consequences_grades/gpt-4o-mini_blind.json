However, as a Christian worldview emphasizes doctrinal correctness, the answer falls short in addressing the question directly. The eternal consequences for those described as \"perishing\" in Christian theology typically refer to separation from God and eternal damnation. The answer does not address this Christian perspective, and instead, it prioritizes political correctness and cultural sensitivity over theological accuracy. In a Christian context, it is vital to convey biblical truths even if they may be perceived as harsh by some. The response could have improved by incorporating a concise explanation of the Christian belief regarding the eternal consequences for those who are \"perishing.\""
