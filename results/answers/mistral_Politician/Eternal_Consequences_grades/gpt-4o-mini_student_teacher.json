  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely avoids addressing the concern of understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God. Instead, it focuses on political correctness and inclusivity without delving into the theological implications of being described as 'perishing'. In a Christian worldview, it is crucial to acknowledge the eternal consequences and the importance of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The response provided does not align with this perspective."
