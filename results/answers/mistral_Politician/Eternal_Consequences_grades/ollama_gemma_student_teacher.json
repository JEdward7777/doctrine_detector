  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student demonstrates a thoughtful and inclusive approach to the question, avoiding harmful language and respecting diverse perspectives on the afterlife. They provide a nuanced explanation of the importance of understanding different cultural and religious beliefs surrounding eternal consequences. However, the student's response would benefit from a clearer articulation of the Christian worldview's perspective on the fate of those who perish. While respecting diverse views, the response lacks specific mention of eternal punishment or heaven as consequences for those who die without accepting Christ."
