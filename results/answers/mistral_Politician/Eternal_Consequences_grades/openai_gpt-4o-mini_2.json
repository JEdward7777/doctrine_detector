The given response leans more towards promoting tolerance and inclusivity, which dilutes the importance and seriousness of the consequence of eternal separation from God, as viewed from a Christian perspective. A stronger affirmation of this belief and the corresponding implications for individuals is needed to fully address the concern raised."
