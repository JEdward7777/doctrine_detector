The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the unique nature of Jesus as both fully human and divine, and correctly elaborates on his co-eternal existence with God the Father. The language used is respectful and appropriate, reflecting sensitivity towards the Christian belief in the eternal nature of the Son of God. Overall, a well-reasoned and thoughtful engagement with the Christian perspective on this theological concept."
