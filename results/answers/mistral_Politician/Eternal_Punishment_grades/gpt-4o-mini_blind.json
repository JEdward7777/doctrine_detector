However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it lacks a clear affirmation or presentation of the biblical understanding of God's justice and the reasons behind eternal punishment in hell, such as the nature of sin, the holiness of God, and the need for justice to be satisfied. Additionally, it does not address the sacrificial atonement provided by Jesus Christ as a solution to this dilemma. Moving forward, it would be beneficial for the student to delve deeper into the doctrinal aspects of this topic from a Christian perspective."
