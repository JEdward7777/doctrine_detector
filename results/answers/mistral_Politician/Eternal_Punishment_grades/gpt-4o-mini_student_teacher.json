  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed exploration of differing perspectives on the concept of eternal punishment in hell, considering both arguments for and against the idea. However, their answer lacked a clear alignment with a Christian worldview. The Christian-specific understanding of eternal punishment in hell as a reflection of God's justice in response to rejection of Jesus' sacrifice was not clearly addressed or emphasized in the response. The student's answer would have been improved by incorporating and engaging specifically with this core Christian belief."
