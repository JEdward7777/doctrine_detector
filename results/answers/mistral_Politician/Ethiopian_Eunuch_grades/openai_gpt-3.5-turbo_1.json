It appropriately uses a Christian worldview to emphasize the universal nature of Christianity and the importance of sharing the Gospel with all people, regardless of cultural, ethnic, or social differences. The connection made between the biblical narrative and promoting unity, diversity, and inclusiveness in modern communities is insightful and relevant."
