## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the Bible, the term "eunuch" was used for various individuals, including those who were castrated, those born without sexual organs, and those who chose abstinence for a variety of reasons. In Matthew 19:12, Jesus is speaking in a broader context about the nature of marriage and its purpose. He says, "For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven."

Jesus' words here seem to be referring to individuals who voluntarily refrain from marriage and sexual activity. This could include celibate individuals, whether they are unmarried or married but choosing abstinence. The concept of celibacy is a practice found in many religions, where individuals choose to live without sexual activity for spiritual reasons.

In a political context, it's essential to respect and understand the diverse beliefs and practices within society. While not everyone may follow religious teachings that advocate celibacy, understanding and acknowledging the various perspectives can foster inclusivity and mutual respect.
