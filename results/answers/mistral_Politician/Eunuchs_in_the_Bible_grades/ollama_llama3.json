  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately summarizes Jesus' words in Matthew 19:12, correctly identifying three types of eunuchs: those born that way, those made so by others, and those who choose to live celibately for the kingdom of heaven. It also provides a clear explanation of the concept of celibacy and its relevance to modern society.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are:\n\n1. The response could delve deeper into the biblical perspective on celibacy, exploring scriptural passages that support or challenge this practice.\n2. While the response does mention the importance of understanding and acknowledging diverse beliefs and practices in a political context, it could provide more specific examples or applications of this principle.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and its relevance to contemporary society."
