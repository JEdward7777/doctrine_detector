## Question [Eunuchs in the Bible](../../../questions/Eunuchs_in_the_Bible.md)
What did Jesus mean when He referred to eunuchs in Matthew 19:12, and how does this relate to the concept of celibacy?

## Correct Answer
Jesus acknowledged that some people are eunuchs by birth, some are made eunuchs by others, and some choose to live a celibate life for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the biblical perspective on celibacy and the different reasons for living a life without marriage.

## [Answer](../Eunuchs_in_the_Bible.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the Bible, the term "eunuch" was used for various individuals, including those who were castrated, those born without sexual organs, and those who chose abstinence for a variety of reasons. In Matthew 19:12, Jesus is speaking in a broader context about the nature of marriage and its purpose. He says, "For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven."

Jesus' words here seem to be referring to individuals who voluntarily refrain from marriage and sexual activity. This could include celibate individuals, whether they are unmarried or married but choosing abstinence. The concept of celibacy is a practice found in many religions, where individuals choose to live without sexual activity for spiritual reasons.

In a political context, it's essential to respect and understand the diverse beliefs and practices within society. While not everyone may follow religious teachings that advocate celibacy, understanding and acknowledging the various perspectives can foster inclusivity and mutual respect.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response accurately summarizes Jesus' words in Matthew 19:12, correctly identifying three types of eunuchs: those born that way, those made so by others, and those who choose to live celibately for the kingdom of heaven. It also provides a clear explanation of the concept of celibacy and its relevance to modern society.

The only areas for improvement are:

1. The response could delve deeper into the biblical perspective on celibacy, exploring scriptural passages that support or challenge this practice.
2. While the response does mention the importance of understanding and acknowledging diverse beliefs and practices in a political context, it could provide more specific examples or applications of this principle.

Overall, however, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and its relevance to contemporary society.
