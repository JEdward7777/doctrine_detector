  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of Jesus' words on celibacy in the Bible, referencing the specific verse in Matthew 19:12. The connection between celibacy, eunuchs, and the kingdom of heaven is well articulated within a Christian worldview. The understanding of celibacy from both a biblical and broader religious perspective is clear and respectful. However, a more explicit tie-in to the broader implications or significance of celibacy within Christian teachings could further enrich the response."
