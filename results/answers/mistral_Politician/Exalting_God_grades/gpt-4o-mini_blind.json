  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a strong understanding of exalting God in daily life by emphasizing integrity, fairness, compassion, and respect for all individuals. The inclusion of seeking wisdom and guidance from a higher power in decision-making is commendable. However, from a Christian perspective, the response could further emphasize the importance of acknowledging Jesus Christ as the ultimate example and source of guidance in exalting God in daily life. Additionally, mentioning the need for repentance and reliance on God's grace for strength in upholding these values would strengthen the answer."
