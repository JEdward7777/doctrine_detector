  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear understanding of the importance of exalting God above all else in life from a Christian perspective. While the student mentions reflecting values and principles, treating others with kindness, and seeking guidance, the essence of exalting God through worship, prayer, and living according to His will is missing. The focus on personal values rather than emphasizing the central role of God in one's daily life leads to a lower grade in this evaluation."
