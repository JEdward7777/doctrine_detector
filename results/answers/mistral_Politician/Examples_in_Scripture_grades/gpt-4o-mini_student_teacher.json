  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples from the Bible that are commonly understood as instances of demon possession. However, the student's response lacks depth in discussing the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith. The student did acknowledge different interpretations of religious texts, which is important, but more could have been said about the significance of demon possession in understanding spiritual warfare and the power of Christ over dark forces."
