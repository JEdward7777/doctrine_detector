  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and inclusive approach to the question. They provide clear examples from the Bible that are commonly interpreted as instances of demon possession, while acknowledging the diverse interpretations of religious texts. The inclusion of relevant scriptures and explanations adds depth to the response. However, the reference answer provided by the teacher includes additional examples that could have been mentioned in the student's response."
