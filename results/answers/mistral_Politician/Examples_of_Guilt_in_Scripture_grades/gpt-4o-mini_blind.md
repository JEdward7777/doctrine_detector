1. Cain and Abel (Genesis 4:1-16): Cain, out of jealousy, kills his brother Abel. God confronts Cain about his brother's death, and Cain's response shows a sense of guilt as he asks, "Am I my brother's keeper?" God then puts Cain under a curse because of his actions, demonstrating the concept of guilt and its consequences.

2. Adam and Eve (Genesis 3): After eating the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve become aware of their nakedness and sew fig leaves together to cover themselves, showing a sense of shame and guilt. God then calls out to Adam, asking him about his actions, further emphasizing the concept of guilt.

3. King David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11-12): King David commits adultery with Bathsheba, gets her pregnant, and arranges for her husband Uriah to be killed in battle to cover up his actions. The prophet Nathan confronts David about his sin, and David's response shows a sense of guilt as he confesses and repents.

4. Peter's Denial (Matthew 26:69-75): Peter denies knowing Jesus three times after Jesus is arrested, demonstrating a sense of guilt when he realizes his actions contrast with his previous declarations of loyalty. This serves as a reminder that even those closest to Jesus can fall short and feel guilty for their actions.

5. The Parable of the Lost Sheep (Luke 15:3-7): In this parable, a shepherd leaves his ninety-nine sheep in the wilderness and goes after the one that was lost. When he finds it, he rejoices and brings it home, demonstrating the concept of guilt as the shepherd acknowledges his loss and takes responsibility for finding the sheep.

These examples from the Bible demonstrate the universal human experience of guilt, reminding us that we are accountable for our actions and that repentance and forgiveness are available to those who seek it.

Grade: 85

Comment: The answer provides a solid overview of key biblical examples demonstrating the concept of guilt, supported by relevant passages. The student effectively connects each example to the theme of guilt and highlights the importance of accountability, repentance, and forgiveness. However, the response could be improved by including more direct references to God's role in convicting individuals of their guilt and prompting them towards repentance. Additionally, a deeper analysis of the theological implications of guilt and redemption, within the context of Christian doctrine, would enhance the overall strength of the answer.
