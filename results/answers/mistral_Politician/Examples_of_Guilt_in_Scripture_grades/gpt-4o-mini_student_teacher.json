However, there is a missed opportunity to incorporate the teacher's reference answer regarding Pilate declaring Jesus innocent and the robber acknowledging guilt compared to Jesus in Luke 23:41. Including this example would have enriched the student's response by showcasing how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment."
