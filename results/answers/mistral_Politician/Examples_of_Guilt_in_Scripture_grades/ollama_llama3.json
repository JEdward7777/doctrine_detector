The examples provided from the Bible do illustrate different aspects of guilt, such as the consequences of sin (Cain and Abel), the impact of sin on human relationships (Adam and Eve), the importance of repentance and confession (King David and Bathsheba), and the role of accountability (Peter's Denial). However, the response does not explicitly connect these examples to the need for divine judgment.\n\nThe added examples from Pilate and the robber do help to highlight the theme of justice and innocence, but they are not directly related to the concept of guilt. A more comprehensive response would have explored how these biblical examples demonstrate the universal human experience of guilt and its connection to the need for divine judgment."
