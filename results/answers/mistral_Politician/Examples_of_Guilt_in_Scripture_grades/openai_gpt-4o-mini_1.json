  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively utilizes biblical examples to illustrate the concept of guilt in the context of justice and innocence, as requested. The examples provided showcase the accountability for one's actions and the need for repentance and forgiveness, aligning well with the Christian worldview on guilt and divine judgment. The reference to Pilate declaring Jesus innocent and the robber acknowledging guilt in comparison to Jesus further adds depth to the understanding of guilt in biblical narratives. Overall, a strong response with relevant biblical support."
