The student effectively highlighted the importance of these miracles in demonstrating Jesus' compassion, authority, and ability to perform miraculous deeds. However, the response could have been further enhanced by explicitly linking these miracles to the significance of Jesus as the Son of God, as stated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a solid effort in addressing the question."
