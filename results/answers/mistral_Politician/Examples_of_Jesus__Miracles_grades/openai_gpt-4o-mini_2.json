  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of significant miracles attributed to Jesus based on the New Testament, acknowledging their role as signs of His divinity and God's kingdom. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how recognizing these miracles can strengthen belief in Jesus as the Son of God. The inclusion of specific biblical references adds credibility to the response and demonstrates a sound understanding of Christian beliefs. A slightly higher grade could be achieved by explicitly connecting each miracle discussed to the broader theological significance of Jesus' divinity and role as the Son of God."
