  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that effectively clarifies the relationship between trust and faith in the context of Christian belief. They have highlighted the interconnected nature of trust and faith, supported their points with relevant examples and biblical references, and emphasized the importance of a personal relationship with God. However, the student's response could have been improved by directly aligning their explanation with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which succinctly states the relationship between trust and faith."
