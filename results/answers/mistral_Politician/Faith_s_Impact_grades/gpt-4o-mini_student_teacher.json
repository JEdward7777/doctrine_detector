  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and comprehensive explanation of how true faith in Jesus can manifest in a person's life, citing several relevant biblical verses. However, the student's response focused more on the outward behaviors and actions resulting from faith rather than on the source of these behaviors, which is the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers. The reference answer emphasizes this crucial aspect of true faith, highlighting the role of the Holy Spirit in producing spiritual fruit. While the student's answer touches on important qualities associated with faith, such as love, service, forgiveness, humility, honesty, hope, perseverance, and gratitude, the key point about the Holy Spirit's transformative work in believers could have been more prominently addressed."
