  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer thoughtfully explores various aspects of true faith in Jesus manifested in daily life. It highlights universal qualities associated with strong faith, such as love for others, service, forgiveness, humility, integrity, hope, and gratitude. The inclusion of relevant scripture references adds credibility to the response. However, the answer could benefit from a more direct connection to the idea of the Holy Spirit producing spiritual fruits or behaviors as a result of true faith."
