  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides an excellent and thorough exploration of how faith in Jesus manifests in daily life through good spiritual fruits and behaviors, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The qualities listed are consistent with biblical teachings and reflect a deep understanding of the evidence of genuine faith in action. The only minor area of improvement could be to explicitly tie the response back to the given answer at the beginning, although the connection is clear throughout the explanation. Overall, this is a strong and insightful response."
