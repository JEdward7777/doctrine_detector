The student effectively cites relevant passages from both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the serious nature of adultery and emphasizing the importance of faithfulness within marriage. The inclusion of guidance on seeking support from spiritual leaders and counselors for healing relationships is commendable. The response could be improved by delving deeper into the theological implications of adultery within a Christian worldview and providing more specific examples or applications of how faithfulness in marriage is lived out practically."
