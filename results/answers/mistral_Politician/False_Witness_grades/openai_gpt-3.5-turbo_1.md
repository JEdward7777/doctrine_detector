# Question [False Witness](../../../questions/False_Witness.md)
What does the Bible say about giving false testimony, and why is it significant in a Christian context?

# Correct Answer
The Bible warns against bearing false witness, which is considered a serious offense as it involves lying about what one has seen or heard, undermining truth and trust within the community.

# Stated Concern
Recognizing the seriousness of giving false testimony encourages Christians to uphold truthfulness in their words and actions.

# Answer by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the Bible, the Ten Commandments given to Moses in Exodus 20:16 states, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor." This commandment emphasizes the importance of truthfulness and honesty in our interactions with others.

In a Christian context, giving false testimony (or lying) is significant because it goes against one of God's fundamental moral laws. Christians are called to live according to these principles, reflecting God's character of truth and righteousness. In Matthew 5:37, Jesus teaches, "Simply let 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and 'No,' 'No'; anything more comes from the evil one."

Additionally, in Proverbs 12:22 it is written, "The LORD detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy." This shows that truthfulness is highly valued by God, and Christians strive to live a life that honors Him.

Giving false testimony not only breaks the law of God but also damages relationships, erodes trust, and undermines justice. As followers of Christ, Christians aim to uphold truth, integrity, and honesty in their words and actions.
