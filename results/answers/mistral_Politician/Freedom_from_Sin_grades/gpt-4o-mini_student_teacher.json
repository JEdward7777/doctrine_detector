However, the answer focused more on the general understanding of sin and repentance rather than emphasizing the urgency and importance of addressing sin for a deeper relationship with God, as specified in the concern. The response could have been improved by directly tying the concept of being 'bound' by sin to hindering the believer's ability to fulfill God's purposes, as highlighted in the reference answer."
