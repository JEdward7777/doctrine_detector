It addresses the concern by highlighting the connection between God's interaction with prophecy and its realization in Scripture. The only minor improvement would be to include a bit more elaboration on the role of faith and trust in God's promises when it comes to the fulfillment of prophecies. Overall, a strong and well-informed response."
