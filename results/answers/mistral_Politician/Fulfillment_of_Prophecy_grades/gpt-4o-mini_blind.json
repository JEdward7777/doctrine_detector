The student effectively references key prophecies from the Old Testament and connects them to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The emphasis on how fulfilled prophecies confirm the divine nature of Jesus and the reliability of Scripture aligns well with orthodox Christian beliefs. The use of specific verses strengthens the argument and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. Well done!"
