## [Answer](../Fulfillment_of_Prophecy.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the Christian faith, fulfilled prophecies serve as significant confirmation of the divine nature of Jesus Christ and the authenticity of the Bible. Fulfillment of prophecies demonstrates a consistent pattern throughout the Old Testament (Tanakh) pointing to the Messiah, who is Jesus in the New Testament.

Some key examples include:
1. The virgin birth (Isaiah 7:14): "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel."
2. The birthplace in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2): "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from old, from ancient times."
3. Jesus's crucifixion (Psalm 22): "Many bulls have encompassed me; strong bulls of Bashan have surrounded me. They open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax; it is melted within my breast."
4. Jesus's resurrection (Psalm 16:10): "For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, nor let your Holy One see decay."

These and many other prophecies are understood by Christians as evidence of God's plan of salvation for humanity through Jesus Christ. The fulfillment of these prophecies provides reassurance and confirmation of the reliability of Scripture and the divine nature of Jesus. It is essential in building faith, particularly for those who seek to understand the significance of Christianity.
