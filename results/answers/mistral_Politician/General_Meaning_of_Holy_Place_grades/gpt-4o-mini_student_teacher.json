  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-articulated and inclusive perspective on the concept of 'holy places' within diverse religious contexts. However, from a Christian worldview concerned with identifying places dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter, the response lacks a clear emphasis on the specific Christian understanding of holy places being designated for worship and encountering God. The student has given valuable insights into the broader understanding of holy places, but a stronger connection to the Christian view would have improved the response."
