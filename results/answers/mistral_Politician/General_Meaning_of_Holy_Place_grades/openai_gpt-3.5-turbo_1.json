However, it does not specifically address the Christian understanding of 'holy place' as a location set apart for God for worship. While it emphasizes the shared human experience of connecting with something greater than oneself, it does not fully align with the concern of identifying places dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter from a Christian worldview."
