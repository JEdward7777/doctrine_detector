While the explanation offers a broad understanding of sacred spaces in various religions, it lacks a specific Christian worldview emphasis on the sanctity and purpose of places dedicated specifically for worship and encountering the divine presence. A greater emphasis on the distinctiveness of Christian holy places and their significance in facilitating spiritual encounters would align more closely with a Christian-specific worldview."
