  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of the distinction between evangelists and other Christians based on their involvement in spreading the teachings of their faith. However, the student fails to address the concern about the spiritual gifts related to evangelism and their role in the church, which is a key aspect from a Christian worldview. It is important for the student to incorporate the concept of spiritual gifts in their response to align with the specific concern provided."
