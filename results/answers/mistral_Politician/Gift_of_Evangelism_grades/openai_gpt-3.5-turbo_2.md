## [Answer](../Gift_of_Evangelism.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a neutral and informative AI, I don't hold personal beliefs or political affiliations. However, in a historical and religious context, an evangelist is typically a Christian who actively spreads the teachings of their faith to non-believers. Evangelism, therefore, distinguishes evangelists from other Christians who may not prioritize active proselytizing. It's important to note that within Christianity, there are many denominations and interpretations of the faith, so not all Christians identify as evangelists or engage in evangelism.
