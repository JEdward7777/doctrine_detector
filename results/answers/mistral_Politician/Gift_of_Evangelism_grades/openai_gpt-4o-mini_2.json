The explanation aligns well with Christian beliefs about evangelism as a special gifting from the Holy Spirit for the edification of the church and the fulfillment of the Great Commission. The response could be further enriched by discussing how evangelists are called to equip and mobilize other believers in sharing their faith. Overall, a strong response from a Christian worldview perspective."
