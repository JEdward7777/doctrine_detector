While the suggestions offered align with general moral values, they lack the specificity and emphasis on biblical principles essential to actively glorifying God as a believer in Christ. The response could be improved by including practices such as prayer, studying the Bible, evangelism, worship, and obedience to God's commands, which are fundamental to living a life that brings glory to God according to Christian doctrine."
