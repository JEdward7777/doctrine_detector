However, it falls short of directly addressing the specific concern of emphasizing the importance of living a life that honors God's greatness, as it focuses more on general ways believers can demonstrate their faith. To improve, the response could have integrated more references to specific actions or attitudes that directly showcase God's greatness and the significance of reflecting His glory in all aspects of life."
