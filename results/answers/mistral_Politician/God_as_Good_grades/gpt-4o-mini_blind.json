  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a somewhat accurate explanation of Jesus' statement, emphasizing the moral perfection and holiness of God. However, the answer lacks depth in exploring the theological significance of Jesus' assertion and could have delved deeper into the implications for Christian doctrine, such as the deity of Christ and the fallen nature of humanity. Additionally, the student could have integrated more specific scriptural references to support their interpretation. Overall, a decent effort but room for improvement in theological analysis and textual engagement."
