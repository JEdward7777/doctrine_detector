It lacks specificity in explaining how the concept of a 'remnant' reflects God's selective grace towards His people in a doctrinally sound manner. The focus on fostering diverse perspectives and promoting harmony, while commendable in a political context, does not provide a thorough analysis of the theological concept being discussed. More emphasis on God's sovereignty, grace, and the biblical significance of the remnant would have improved the response."
