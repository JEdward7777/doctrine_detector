  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful response by referencing specific verses from the Bible that highlight God's compassionate nature. They effectively connected these verses to the broader concept of divine love and mercy. However, the student could have further strengthened their answer by directly stating that the Bible states God is compassionate, full of love, and mercy, as mentioned in the reference answer."
