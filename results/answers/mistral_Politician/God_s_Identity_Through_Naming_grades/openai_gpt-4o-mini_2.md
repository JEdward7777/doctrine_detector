 As a politician, I would approach this question from a perspective that seeks to foster understanding, empathy, and respect for all beliefs and faiths. In the context of the concept of being "called by my name" in relation to one's relationship with God, it signifies a profound sense of personal connection and intimacy between an individual and their divine entity.

When we are 'called by our name,' it implies that God knows us deeply and individually, recognizing our unique identities, experiences, and potential. It suggests a level of familiarity and love that transcends any barrier, uniting the believer with the divine. This connection emphasizes the notion that every person matters, is valued, and has a purpose in the grand scheme of things.

Moreover, being 'called by my name' serves as a reminder to treat others similarly, recognizing their individuality, worth, and unique relationship with God. It encourages empathy, compassion, and respect for all people, reflecting our shared humanity and interconnectedness within the divine plan. By embracing this concept, we strive towards building a more inclusive, understanding, and loving society that fosters harmony among its members.
