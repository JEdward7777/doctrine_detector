However, it falls short of providing a thorough explanation from a Christian worldview. It lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to delve into the theological implications of God's intentionality and purpose in calling individuals. A stronger emphasis on Biblical references and Christian teachings would have strengthened the answer."
