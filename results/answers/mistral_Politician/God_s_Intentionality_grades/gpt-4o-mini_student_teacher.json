  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student touched on the importance of intentionality and purpose in God's calling, which aligns with the concern provided. However, the response veered off into a discussion on inclusivity in language, which, while important, is not directly addressing the significance of the term 'call' in relation to God's intentionality. The student should focus more on the specific Christian worldview perspective when discussing God's calling."
