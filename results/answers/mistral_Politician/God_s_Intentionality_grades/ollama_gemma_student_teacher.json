  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the significance of the term \"call\" in relation to God's interaction with humanity. \n\nThe student acknowledges the intentional nature of God's call while also emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and respecting diverse perspectives. The response aligns well with the teacher's reference answer, highlighting the deliberate nature of God's invitation for individuals to fulfill a specific role in His plan.\n\nHowever, the student's political-correctness approach may be seen as slightly evasive in its elaboration of the divine plan or destiny, particularly in the context of a Christian worldview. A more explicit reference to God's purpose or calling in Christianity could enhance the depth of the response."
