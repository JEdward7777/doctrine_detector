They correctly emphasize that God's jealousy reflects His passionate love and desire for exclusive devotion from His people. However, the student's answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning that God's jealousy is rooted in His holiness and righteous nature, which is essential to maintain doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview."
