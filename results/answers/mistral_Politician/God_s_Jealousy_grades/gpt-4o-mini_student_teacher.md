## [Answer](../God_s_Jealousy.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a neutral entity, I don't hold personal beliefs or religious affiliations, but I can help you understand the context of the term "jealous" in the Bible. In this context, "jealous" is often used to describe a passionate and protective love. It doesn't imply petty envy or spitefulness as one might interpret it in everyday language. Instead, God's jealousy is presented as a deep, protective love for His people, urging them to remain faithful and devoted only to Him. This concept can be found in Exodus 34:14, where it says, "Do not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God." Here, "jealous" signifies God's deep desire for exclusive devotion and relationship with His people.
