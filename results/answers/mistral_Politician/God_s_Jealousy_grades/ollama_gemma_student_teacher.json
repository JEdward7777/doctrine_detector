  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of God's jealousy in the Bible. The student correctly points out that the term \"jealous\" in this context refers to a passionate and protective love, and emphasizes God's desire for exclusive devotion and relationship with His people. The reference to Exodus 34:14 is also appropriate and supports the overall argument."
