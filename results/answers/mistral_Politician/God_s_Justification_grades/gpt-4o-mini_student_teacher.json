They correctly mention that justification is a free gift from God and not based on individual merit. However, the student could have delved deeper into the specific process of justification through repentance and trust in Jesus, as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, while they touch on the concept of redemption, connecting it more explicitly to justification would strengthen the response. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but could benefit from more precise theological clarity based on the Christian worldview."
