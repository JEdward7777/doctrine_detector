  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian doctrine of justification and its significance in salvation. It accurately explains that justification is the act of being declared righteous by God through faith in Jesus Christ and emphasizes that it is a free gift from God. Additionally, the student correctly highlights the importance of redemption for sinners and the basis of forgiveness in God's mercy and love. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific mechanism of redemption and the role of repentance in the process of justification."
