The mention of the key biblical reference from Romans helps support the explanation. The response also touches on the importance of redemption and the role of God's mercy and love in forgiveness. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of justification in relation to salvation, perhaps by discussing how it relates to the atonement and Christ's sacrifice."
