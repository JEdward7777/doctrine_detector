The discussion of Yahweh as a symbol of God's eternal existence and the one true God aligns well with the concern of deepening reverence and understanding in worship. The response is sensitive and respectful in its approach, promoting inclusivity and mutual respect among different faith traditions. Overall, a well-developed and insightful response."
