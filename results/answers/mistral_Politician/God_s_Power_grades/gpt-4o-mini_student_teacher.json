  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of the term 'Almighty' in religious contexts, acknowledging the concept of God's omnipotence. However, the student fails to emphasize the significance of God's complete authority over all creation, which is a crucial aspect of understanding God's nature in a Christian worldview. The student also introduces the idea of political correctness and inclusivity, which may dilute the specific Christian understanding of God's omnipotence. Encouraging the student to focus more on the authority and sovereignty of God in their response would improve their grade."
