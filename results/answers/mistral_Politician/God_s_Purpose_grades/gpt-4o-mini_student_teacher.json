  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student's response emphasizes inclusivity, understanding, and respectful dialogue as important values in discussing spirituality, it lacks a clear foundation in Christian beliefs and practices. While respecting diversity and individual journeys is important, the answer does not explicitly reference prayer, Bible reading, seeking counsel from mature Christians, or observing God's providence - all key aspects of discerning God's plan in a Christian worldview.\n\nThe student's response is thoughtful and respectful, but it could be enhanced by incorporating more specific Christian principles and practices related to discerning God's plan. Prioritizing alignment with biblical teachings and seeking wisdom from Christian sources would strengthen the answer."
