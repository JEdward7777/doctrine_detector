However, the concern raised about believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose or calling is not directly addressed in the response. Encouraging individuals to follow their conscience and inner voice, while valuable, may not necessarily resolve feelings of spiritual uncertainty. More emphasis on the importance of seeking God's guidance through prayer, Scripture, and seeking wise counsel could have enhanced the response."
