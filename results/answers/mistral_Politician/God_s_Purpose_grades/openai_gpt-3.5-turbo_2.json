However, it lacked a strong emphasis on the authority of Scripture as the ultimate source of divine guidance. Encouraging believers to seek answers through personal conscience and diverse perspectives could potentially lead to subjective interpretations or confusion. It would have been stronger with a clearer affirmation of the Bible's role as the foundational source of Truth for believers."
