  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provides a good overview of how God introduces Himself using various names in the Bible, emphasizing different aspects of His character. However, the explanation strays off course by suggesting that the language used by God in the Bible may not be politically correct according to modern standards. This could cause confusion or misinterpretation regarding the nature and divine inspiration of Scripture. The student should focus more on doctrinal correctness and avoid introducing unnecessary cultural relativism into a discussion on God's self-revelation in the Bible."
