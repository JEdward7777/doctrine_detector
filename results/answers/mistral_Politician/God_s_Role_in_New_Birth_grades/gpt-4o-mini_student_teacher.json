  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good understanding of the concept of being \"born again\" in Christianity and acknowledged the central role of God in the process. However, the student's response somewhat diluted the emphasis on God's sovereignty and grace compared to the teacher's reference answer. It would have been stronger if the student had explicitly stated that it is God's work that causes a person to be born again and highlighted the divine initiative in the process of salvation."
