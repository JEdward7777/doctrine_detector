However, from a Christian worldview, the concept of 'Appointed Time' should be rooted in the understanding of God's sovereignty and control over all things, rather than simply as a tool for finding meaning and purpose in life events. Additionally, the emphasis on surrendering to a divine will should be balanced with the importance of personal responsibility and the role of free will. The answer lacks a clear connection to Christian teachings and could benefit from more explicit references to biblical principles and God's plan of salvation through Jesus Christ."
