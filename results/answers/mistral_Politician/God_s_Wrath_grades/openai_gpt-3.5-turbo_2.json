However, it does not directly address the concern raised about God's punishment being a pouring out of His wrath upon unbelievers. The response could have delved deeper into the consequences of disbelief in the context of God's judgment, aligning it more closely with a Christian-specific understanding of salvation and judgment. Improving the connection between the provided answer and the concern would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
