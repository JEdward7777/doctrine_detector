Additionally, the student acknowledges the importance of historical context and cultural background in understanding religious terms. However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific examples or references to support the claim that \"the zeal of the Lord\" refers to God's strong and persistent efforts to bless His people and ensure justice is served."
