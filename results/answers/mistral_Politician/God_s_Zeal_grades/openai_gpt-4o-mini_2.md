 As a neutral entity, I don't have personal beliefs or feelings. However, in many interpretations of religious texts, "the zeal of the Lord" often refers to the intense devotion and passion with which God acts towards His people. It can symbolize God's unwavering commitment to His principles, His justice, and His love for humanity.
