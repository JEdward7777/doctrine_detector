However, the response could have been improved by emphasizing the scriptural basis for understanding godliness and by incorporating more specific references to relevant biblical passages beyond just mentioning 1 Timothy 2:3-4 and Titus 2:12. Additionally, the statement about interpretations varying widely across different religious groups and individuals could be misleading as the core concept of godliness remains consistent throughout orthodox Christian theology."
