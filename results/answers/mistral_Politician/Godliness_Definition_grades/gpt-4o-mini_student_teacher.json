  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of how different Christian denominations interpret 'godliness' based on Bible verses, they missed the opportunity to provide a clear and straightforward incorporation of godliness into daily life and actions. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes acting in a way that pleases God, obeying Him, and living righteously, which could have been explicitly related to daily life and actions in the student's response. Therefore, the student's answer could have been improved by directly connecting the concept of godliness to practical living examples or specific behaviors one should exhibit daily."
