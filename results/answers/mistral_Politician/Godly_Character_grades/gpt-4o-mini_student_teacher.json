  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough list of the fruits of the Holy Spirit and demonstrated a good understanding of the characteristics of a godly individual. However, the answer goes beyond the reference answer by including additional fruits such as goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and forbearance. While these qualities are commendable, the focus should have been more on the core fruits mentioned in the reference answer. The student could have emphasized more on cultivating these essential fruits in daily life for godly character."
