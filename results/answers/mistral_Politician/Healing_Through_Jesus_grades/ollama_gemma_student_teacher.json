They provide textual evidence from the Gospels to support their claims. The conclusion effectively connects Jesus's example to broader concepts of promoting inclusivity and political correctness. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from including more specific details about the methods Jesus used for casting out demons, as per the reference answer. This would further strengthen the student's response."
