The examples from Mark and Luke are relevant and well-explained, showcasing Jesus' engagement with these individuals rather than shunning or ignoring them. However, the response does not specifically address the concern about recognizing Jesus' authority over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing.\n\nWhile the response mentions Jesus' casting out of demons, it could have further explored the biblical basis for His authority to do so. Additionally, the example could have been expanded upon to demonstrate more explicitly how Jesus' approach can serve as a guide for promoting inclusivity and kindness towards others. Nevertheless, the response does provide a strong foundation for understanding Jesus' ministry and its relevance to our world today."
