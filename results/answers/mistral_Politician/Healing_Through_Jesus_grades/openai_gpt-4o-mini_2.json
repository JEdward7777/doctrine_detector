It emphasizes Jesus's authority over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing, aligning with the concern provided. The scriptural references add depth to the explanation, showcasing a strong understanding of the Christian worldview. However, a stronger tie back to the specific response regarding 'casting out' demons would further enhance the coherence of the argument."
