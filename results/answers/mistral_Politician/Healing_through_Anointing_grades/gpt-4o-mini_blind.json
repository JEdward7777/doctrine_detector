However, it falls short in emphasizing the doctrinal importance of anointing in relation to healing within a Christian worldview. The answer lacks depth in exploring the spiritual implications and Biblical foundations of anointing for healing, focusing more on cultural and universal interpretations. More Scriptural references and doctrinal explanations would have strengthened the response."
