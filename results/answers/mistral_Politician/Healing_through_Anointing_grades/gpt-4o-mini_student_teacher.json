  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and informative response that discusses the practice of anointing in the New Testament and its relation to healing. They accurately described the historical and biblical significance of anointing with oil in connection to healing. However, the student's answer focused more on cultural sensitivity and diversity rather than emphasizing the Christian perspective on anointing for healing. To improve their grade, they should have highlighted the spiritual aspect of anointing as a practice for seeking healing through God's intervention."
