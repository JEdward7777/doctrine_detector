  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of who was allowed to approach the Ark of the Covenant and under what circumstances according to biblical accounts. The response effectively highlighted the sanctity of the Ark, the role of the High Priest in approaching it, the consequences of improper handling, and the importance of following proper protocol. However, the response could have been further enhanced by incorporating more scriptural references to support the points made and by explicitly mentioning the cherubim statues on the Ark's cover, which played a significant role in the restrictions on who could approach it."
