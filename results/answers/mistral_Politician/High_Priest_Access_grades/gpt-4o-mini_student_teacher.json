  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed answer that accurately covers the significance and strict protocol surrounding who was allowed to approach the Ark of the Covenant. The student effectively incorporated biblical references and narratives to support their explanation. The only minor deduction is for slight elaboration beyond the concise reference answer provided, but overall a very strong response."
