  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response partially addresses the concern by recognizing the high priest's role in approaching the Ark, specifically stating that he did so once a year on the Day of Atonement. However, it does not fully develop this point or explore its significance in the Israelites' relationship with God and the covenant. The response also provides additional context about the Ark's construction, significance, and proper handling, which is relevant to understanding its role in the Israelite faith.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest expanding on the high priest's role and how it reflects the importance of ritual and ceremonial practices in the Israelites' relationship with God."
