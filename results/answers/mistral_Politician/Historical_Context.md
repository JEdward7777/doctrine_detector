## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the context of your question, the concept of "remnant" as seen in Isaiah and Amos refers to a small group of people who remain faithful to God amidst widespread apostasy or destruction. This concept is significant because it offers hope that even in difficult times, a righteous and devout community will survive and thrive.

1. Isaiah 1:9 (NIV) - "Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah."

In this verse from Isaiah, the prophet laments the sinfulness of Judah and warns that without God's protection, they would be destroyed like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. However, God's promise is that a remnant will survive and carry on His work.

2. Amos 5:15 (NIV) - "I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel, and they will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them; they will plant vineyards and drink their wine; they will make gardens and eat their fruit."

This verse from Amos speaks to a time when God's people will be restored after judgment. The remnant that remains faithful will rebuild their destroyed cities, cultivate the land, and enjoy its fruits. This image of restoration offers hope in difficult times, emphasizing that even in the face of destruction, there is always the possibility of renewal.

These examples illustrate the concept of "remnant" as a small group of faithful individuals who survive destruction and ultimately bring about restoration and renewal. They serve as a reminder that no matter how challenging the circumstances, God's work will continue through His chosen people.
