However, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological significance of unleavened bread, such as the removal of sin and impurity represented by leaven in the Bible. Additionally, although the answer touches on respect and sensitivity towards the topic, it could have emphasized the theological importance of the Passover and how it points to Jesus Christ as the ultimate Passover Lamb in Christian beliefs. It demonstrates a basic understanding but lacks theological depth from a Christian perspective."
