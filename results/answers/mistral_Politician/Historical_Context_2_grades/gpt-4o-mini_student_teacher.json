  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer at 85.\n\nThe student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of eating unleavened bread during the Israelites' escape from Egypt. They correctly mention the biblical account and the symbolism of unleavened bread in Passover. The student also shows respect and sensitivity towards the religious significance of the event. However, the wording and detail in their response could be more concise and focused on the specific reason for eating unleavened bread as mentioned in the reference answer. It is important to clearly connect the historical event to the religious practice, as outlined in the concern provided."
