  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful explanations of Isaiah 1:9 and Amos 5:15 in relation to the concept of \"remnant,\" highlighting the survival and restoration of God's faithful people. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by incorporating the specific historical contexts of a remnant returning to Canaan after exile and God's preservation of a remnant despite judgment as mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, the student effectively conveyed the significance of the remnant concept in offering hope and emphasizing God's faithfulness, but deeper analysis and integration of biblical events addressing the historical significance of a remnant would have enhanced the response further."
