The inclusion of relevant verses and explanations from these biblical texts demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic. However, to further enhance the response, additional references to the historical context of exile and judgment as described in the Bible could have been beneficial. Overall, the answer effectively addresses the concern with a Christian-specific worldview."
