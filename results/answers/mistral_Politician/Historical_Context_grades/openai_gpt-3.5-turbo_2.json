  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-explained and detailed analysis of the concept of \"remnant\" in Isaiah and Amos in relation to God's promises. The mention of the remnant returning to Canaan after exile in Isaiah and God's preservation of a remnant despite judgment in Amos aligns well with the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises. The examples provided from the Bible verses support the understanding of the concept within the Christian worldview. The response effectively connects the textual references to the broader theme of God's faithfulness and preservation of a faithful community, reflecting a strong grasp of the subject matter."
