They rightly mention the internal conflicts, potential economic hardships, and cultural tensions that arose from the division. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more specifically on the governance, culture, and relations with Roman authorities, as the reference answer does. Additionally, the response lacks a direct connection to the socio-political dynamics faced by Jesus and the early church, which is important for fully grasping the significance of this historical context from a Christian worldview."
