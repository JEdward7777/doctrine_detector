The focus on how the division affected governance, culture, and relations with Roman authorities aligns well with the concern about understanding the socio-political dynamics faced by Jesus and the early church. However, while the response is thorough, there could have been more emphasis on the spiritual or religious implications for the Jewish community, particularly in relation to their faith and interactions with Jesus and the early Christian movement."
