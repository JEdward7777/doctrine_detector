  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of individuals from the Bible who built altars and explains the significance of those acts within their historical and cultural context. The answer appropriately emphasizes the importance of these actions in demonstrating faith, obedience, and devotion to God. The only area that could be improved is the use of language around modern political correctness, which may not be directly relevant to the discussion of building altars in a Christian worldview. Otherwise, the answer effectively conveys the significance of building altars in the Bible."
