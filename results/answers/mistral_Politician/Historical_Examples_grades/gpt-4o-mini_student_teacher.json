  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-detailed response showcasing multiple examples of individuals building altars in the Bible. They accurately explained the significance of each act and its context within the individual's story. However, there was a slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer by not including Noah and Abraham, who are key figures in altar-building moments. It is essential for the student to incorporate all relevant examples for a comprehensive understanding."
