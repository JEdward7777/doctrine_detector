  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and sensitive approach to introducing the concept of the Holy Spirit in unfamiliar contexts. \n\nThe student correctly highlights the importance of cultural sensitivity and respecting diverse interpretations of Christian beliefs. Additionally, acknowledging the variation in understanding the Trinity helps foster an open and inclusive discussion. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from including more specific examples or references to biblical passages that highlight the role of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life. This would reinforce the connection between the concept and its practical implications."
