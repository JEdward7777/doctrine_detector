  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provided a thoughtful and respectful approach to introducing the concept of the Holy Spirit to individuals unfamiliar with it, acknowledging the diversity within religious beliefs. While the response did not directly align with the specified answer of introducing the Holy Spirit as God's Spirit, part of the Trinity, and explaining His role in the believer's life through sound teaching, it still approached the topic with sensitivity and cultural respect. The concern about clear, contextual teaching to prevent misconceptions was partially addressed, but a more direct and focused explanation on the Holy Spirit's role according to Christian beliefs could have been included for a stronger alignment with the provided answer."
