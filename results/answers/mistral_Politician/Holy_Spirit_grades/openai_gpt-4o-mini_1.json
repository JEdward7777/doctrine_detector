However, it could have been strengthened by clearly articulating the essential role of the Holy Spirit as part of the Trinity and emphasizing His work in the believer's life through sound teaching. Overall, while the approach is commendable, there is room for improvement in providing clear, contextual teaching to prevent misconceptions."
