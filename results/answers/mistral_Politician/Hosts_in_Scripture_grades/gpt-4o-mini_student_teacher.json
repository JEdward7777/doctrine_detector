  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the term \"hosts\" in Scripture, correctly identifying it as referring to angelic beings or armies of angels. The student could have improved by including a more explicit mention of the spirit world and celestial bodies like stars and planets as part of what \"hosts\" can encompass, as noted in the reference answer. However, the student's response demonstrates a good grasp of the concept and shows a willingness to acknowledge differing interpretations, which is commendable."
