 In Christian scripture, the term "hosts" or "heavenly hosts" is primarily used to refer to angelic beings or armies of angels. This term is found numerous times in both the Old Testament (for example, Psalm 148:2) and the New Testament (Luke 2:13). The specific encompassment of the term "hosts" can vary depending on the context but generally refers to a multitude of angels. It's essential to note that interpretations may differ among various religious groups, and it is always advisable to consider different perspectives when discussing scripture.

Comment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the term "hosts" in Scripture, correctly identifying it as referring to angelic beings or armies of angels. The student could have improved by including a more explicit mention of the spirit world and celestial bodies like stars and planets as part of what "hosts" can encompass, as noted in the reference answer. However, the student's response demonstrates a good grasp of the concept and shows a willingness to acknowledge differing interpretations, which is commendable.
