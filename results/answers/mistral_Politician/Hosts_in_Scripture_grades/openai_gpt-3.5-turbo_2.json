However, it could be strengthened by emphasizing the significance of spiritual warfare and divine authority in shaping a believer's perspective on prayer and engaging in spiritual battles. Connecting the concept of hosts to the broader spiritual warfare narrative in Christianity would enhance the depth of the response from a Christian worldview."
