It acknowledges the varying contexts in which the term is used and the importance of considering different perspectives when interpreting scripture. However, the response could further elaborate on how understanding the scope of spiritual warfare and divine authority influences a believer's perspective on prayer and engaging in spiritual battles. Integrating this aspect would have strengthened the analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
