This term is found numerous times in both the Old Testament (for example, Psalm 148:2) and the New Testament (Luke 2:13). The specific encompassment of the term "hosts" can vary depending on the context but generally refers to a multitude of angels. It's essential to note that interpretations may differ among various religious groups, and it is always advisable to consider different perspectives when discussing scripture.
