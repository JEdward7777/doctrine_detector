  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of how a person can be declared righteous in the Christian faith through faith in Jesus Christ. They correctly emphasize the importance of belief in Jesus as savior for receiving forgiveness of sins and becoming righteous before God. The student's answer aligns well with the core biblical teachings on righteousness and salvation. However, the student could have further emphasized the concept of imputed righteousness, where Jesus' righteousness is credited to believers, in explaining how one can be declared righteous. Overall, a well-constructed and insightful response."
