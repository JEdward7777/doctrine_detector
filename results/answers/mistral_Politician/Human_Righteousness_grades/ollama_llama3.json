  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd grade this response a 90.\n\nThe response accurately reflects the biblical teaching that a person's righteousness comes through faith in Jesus Christ, and not through human effort or achievement. The mention of Romans 3:23 and Ephesians 2:8-9 adds support to this claim, which is consistent with the given answer.\n\nThe concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is also well-addressed, as the response clearly explains that a person's righteousness is not earned or achieved, but rather is a gift from God through faith in Jesus.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give this response a perfect score is that it could be slightly strengthened by more explicitly linking the concept of political correctness to the human tendency to try to earn or achieve righteousness. However, overall, this is a strong and accurate response that effectively addresses the concern and supports the given answer.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical teaching on human righteousness and effectively communicates it in a way that is easy to follow. It also does a good job of addressing the concern by explaining the basis for human righteousness as related to faith in Jesus."
