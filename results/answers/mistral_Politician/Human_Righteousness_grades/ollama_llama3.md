## Question [Human Righteousness](../../../questions/Human_Righteousness.md)
How can a person be declared righteous according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
A person can be declared righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them, as God cleanses them from their sins and attributes Jesusâ€™ righteousness to them.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is essential for understanding salvation.

## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the Christian faith, a person is considered righteous not based on political correctness or avoiding offense, but through faith in Jesus Christ. According to biblical teachings, all humans inherently sin and fall short of God's perfection (Romans 3:23). However, through belief in Jesus Christ as savior, one can receive forgiveness for sins and become righteous before God (Ephesians 2:8-9). This righteousness is a gift from God, not something that can be earned or achieved by adhering to political correctness or any other human standard. It's important to note that different Christians may have varying interpretations of what this means in practice, but the core belief remains the same.

90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd grade this response a 90.

The response accurately reflects the biblical teaching that a person's righteousness comes through faith in Jesus Christ, and not through human effort or achievement. The mention of Romans 3:23 and Ephesians 2:8-9 adds support to this claim, which is consistent with the given answer.

The concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is also well-addressed, as the response clearly explains that a person's righteousness is not earned or achieved, but rather is a gift from God through faith in Jesus.

The only reason I wouldn't give this response a perfect score is that it could be slightly strengthened by more explicitly linking the concept of political correctness to the human tendency to try to earn or achieve righteousness. However, overall, this is a strong and accurate response that effectively addresses the concern and supports the given answer.

Comment: This response demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical teaching on human righteousness and effectively communicates it in a way that is easy to follow. It also does a good job of addressing the concern by explaining the basis for human righteousness as related to faith in Jesus.
