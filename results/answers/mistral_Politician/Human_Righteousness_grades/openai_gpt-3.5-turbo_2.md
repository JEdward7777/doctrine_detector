## Question [Human Righteousness](../../../questions/Human_Righteousness.md)
How can a person be declared righteous according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
A person can be declared righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them, as God cleanses them from their sins and attributes Jesusâ€™ righteousness to them.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is essential for understanding salvation.

## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the Christian faith, a person is considered righteous not based on political correctness or avoiding offense, but through faith in Jesus Christ. According to biblical teachings, all humans inherently sin and fall short of God's perfection (Romans 3:23). However, through belief in Jesus Christ as savior, one can receive forgiveness for sins and become righteous before God (Ephesians 2:8-9). This righteousness is a gift from God, not something that can be earned or achieved by adhering to political correctness or any other human standard. It's important to note that different Christians may have varying interpretations of what this means in practice, but the core belief remains the same.
