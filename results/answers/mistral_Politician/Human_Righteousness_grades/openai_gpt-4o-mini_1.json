  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively clarifies the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus within the context of Christian beliefs. It emphasizes the core Christian teaching that righteousness is obtained through trust in Jesus for salvation and the imputation of His righteousness to believers by God. The integration of biblical references (Romans 3:23, Ephesians 2:8-9) further strengthens the argument. Overall, this response aligns well with Christian beliefs and effectively addresses the concern provided."
