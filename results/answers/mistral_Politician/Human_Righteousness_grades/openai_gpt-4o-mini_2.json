It aligns well with Christian theology by highlighting the concept of imputed righteousness through trust in Jesus. The only suggestion for improvement would be to possibly include a reference to specific biblical verses supporting the idea of God cleansing individuals from sin and attributing Jesus' righteousness to them, for a more thorough grounding in scripture."
