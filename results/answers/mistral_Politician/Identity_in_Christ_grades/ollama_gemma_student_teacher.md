## [Answer](../Identity_in_Christ.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 When God says "I have called you by name," it refers to the personal relationship that He desires to establish with each individual. This concept is rooted in the biblical narrative of God calling specific people, such as Abram (later Abraham), Isaiah, and Samuel, by their names. It signifies that God knows us intimately, cares deeply for us, and wants a meaningful connection with us on an individual level. It's essential to remember that this idea is interpreted differently across various cultures, belief systems, and communities, and it's crucial to approach discussions about religious themes with sensitivity and respect for everyone's beliefs.
