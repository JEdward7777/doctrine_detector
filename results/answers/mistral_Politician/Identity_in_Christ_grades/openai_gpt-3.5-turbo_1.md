# Answer by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 When God says "I have called you by name," it refers to the personal relationship that He desires to establish with each individual. This concept is rooted in the biblical narrative of God calling specific people, such as Abram (later Abraham), Isaiah, and Samuel, by their names. It signifies that God knows us intimately, cares deeply for us, and wants a meaningful connection with us on an individual level. It's essential to remember that this idea is interpreted differently across various cultures, belief systems, and communities, and it's crucial to approach discussions about religious themes with sensitivity and respect for everyone's beliefs.

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of being called by name by God, emphasizing the personal and intimate relationship He desires to have with each individual. It acknowledges the biblical examples of individuals being called by name and highlights the significance of God's personal knowledge and care for us. Additionally, the response appropriately encourages sensitivity and respect when discussing religious themes across different beliefs. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly tie this concept to understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ, although it is indirectly implied throughout the response. Overall, a well-rounded and insightful answer from a Christian worldview perspective.
