  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive understanding of the significance of Jesus's name across various religious traditions and emphasized the moral teachings associated with Jesus. However, the student did not directly address the specific Christian worldview concern regarding Jesus's role as a Savior and the meaning of His name in relation to saving people from their sins. Encouragement to align the response more closely with the Christian perspective would have improved the grade."
