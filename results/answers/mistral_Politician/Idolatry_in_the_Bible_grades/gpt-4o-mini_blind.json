  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComments: The student's response lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to address the question from a Christian perspective. It neglects to acknowledge the Bible's teachings on idolatry as a direct violation of God's commandments and the seriousness of such sin in God's eyes. The attempt to approach the subject with inclusivity and avoid moral judgments detracts from the biblical narrative and the consequences outlined in Scripture. The student should focus more on accurately presenting the biblical perspective on idolatry rather than downplaying its significance for the sake of general inclusivity."
