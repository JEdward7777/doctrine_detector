However, it falls short of addressing the core doctrinal reason behind why Christians proclaim the good news, which is centered on the belief in Jesus Christ as the savior and the necessity of salvation through Him. The emphasis on mutual respect and open dialogue is commendable, but the foundational aspect of Christian faith should have been articulated more clearly. The answer could benefit from a stronger doctrinal foundation and a clearer presentation of the Christian worldview on the significance of sharing the good news."
