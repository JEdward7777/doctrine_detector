 As a historian, I don't attribute personal motivations or modern concepts of political correctness to historical figures or groups like the Sadducees and Pharisees. However, understanding their roles in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus is crucial to grasping the broader context of that time period.

The Sadducees were a Jewish sect primarily composed of the priestly class and the wealthy. They accepted only the written Torah (the Five Books of Moses) as authoritative, rejecting beliefs such as the immortality of the soul and the concept of resurrection. Jesus' teachings about these subjects could have been perceived by the Sadducees as a threat to their religious and social order.

The Pharisees, on the other hand, were a larger and more diverse group that emphasized oral traditions and interpretations in addition to the written Torah. While some Pharisees may have found common ground with Jesus due to his teachings' alignment with their beliefs about personal piety, others might have been troubled by his criticisms of the religious leaders and practices they endorsed.

In the trial of Jesus, both groups likely played significant roles: the Sadducees provided the political and religious establishment that authorized and oversaw the trial, while Pharisees could have influenced public opinion against Jesus or brought him to the authorities in the first place. It's essential to note that this is not a simple tale of two factions working together maliciously to eliminate Jesus; instead, it reflects the complexities and tensions within ancient Jewish society at the time.

As for what this reveals about their character: The Sadducees were pragmatic and focused on maintaining their social status and power through their connection with the Temple and its rituals. They could be seen as rigid and resistant to change. The Pharisees, on the other hand, were more flexible in their interpretations of religious law but also tended to prioritize adherence to traditional norms and customs. Their character can be seen as a balance between innovation and conservatism.

However, it's important to remember that these depictions are generalizations based on historical accounts, and actual individuals within these groups likely exhibited a broader range of traits and motivations.
