The inclusion of the relevant biblical references is commendable. However, the response could have benefited from further emphasis on the significance of these promises within the overarching plan of God's redemption for humanity through the lineage of Abraham. Additionally, a stronger connection to the Christian understanding of the fulfillment of these promises through Jesus Christ would have enhanced the theological depth of the answer."
