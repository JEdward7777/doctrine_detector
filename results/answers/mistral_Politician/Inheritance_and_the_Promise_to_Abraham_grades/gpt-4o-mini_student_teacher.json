  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate summary of the promises God made to Abraham and his descendants regarding the land of Canaan. Although the student included additional information on the promises, such as the population promise and the blessing promise, the essence of the covenant was captured well in the teacher's reference answer. The student demonstrated a good understanding of God's covenant with Abraham and its implications for believers."
