The response does not delve deeper into the implications of this covenant for believers or provide a comprehensive overview of the promises made to Abraham.\n\nThe response also lacks nuance and context, as it simplistically states that the land would belong to them forever without acknowledging the complexities and sensitivities surrounding issues of land, identity, and inheritance."
