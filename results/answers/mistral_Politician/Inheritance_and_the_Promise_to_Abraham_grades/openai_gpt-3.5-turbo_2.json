The inclusion of key promises such as land, population, inheritance, and blessing, demonstrates a strong understanding of God's covenant with Abraham. The response could have further emphasized the spiritual significance and implications of these promises for believers, in relation to faith, obedience, and God's faithfulness throughout history. Nonetheless, the response effectively addresses the concern within a Christian worldview perspective."
