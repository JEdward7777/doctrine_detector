  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85. The student provides a comprehensive and accurate overview of the steps to inherit eternal life according to Christian teachings in the Bible. However, there is a slight lack of emphasis on the crucial role of grace in salvation, which is a core Christian doctrine. Mentioning that salvation is a gift from God through grace would have further strengthened the response. Additionally, the student could have included more scriptural references to support each point. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated, but there is room for improvement in incorporating key theological concepts."
