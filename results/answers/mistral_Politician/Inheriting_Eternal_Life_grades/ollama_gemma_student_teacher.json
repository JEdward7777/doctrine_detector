  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the Christian perspective on the path to eternal life. It accurately references relevant biblical passages and explains the key elements of salvation, including acknowledgement of sin, repentance, faith in Jesus Christ, living a life aligned with God's teachings, and prayer and fellowship. \n\nHowever, the answer would benefit from referencing the specific interaction between Jesus and the expert in Jewish law as specified in the reference answer. Including this detail would strengthen the connection to the teacher's expectations."
