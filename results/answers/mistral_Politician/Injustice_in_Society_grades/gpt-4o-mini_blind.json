  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 80.\n\nWhile the student addresses several important examples of injustice in our world today and provides appropriate ways for Christians to respond, there are a couple of areas where the answer could be improved:\n\n1. The response could have explicitly stated the importance of relying on biblical principles and teachings when addressing these issues. Connecting the call to address injustice with biblical mandates would have strengthened the Christian perspective of the answer.\n\n2. The answer could have emphasized the need for prayer and reliance on God's guidance in seeking justice and addressing these issues. As Christians, prayer should be a foundational aspect of our response to injustice.\n\nOverall, the student provides a solid overview of various injustices and suggests practical ways for Christians to respond, but incorporating a more direct integration of Christian doctrine and the importance of prayer would have enhanced the answer."
