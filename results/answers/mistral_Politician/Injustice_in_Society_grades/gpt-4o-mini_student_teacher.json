  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and insightful response to the question, addressing various current injustices in the world and suggesting ways in which Christians can respond. The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the need for activism and promoting fairness based on biblical principles. The student effectively integrates Christian values and principles into their proposed solutions to each issue. However, the response could be improved by directly connecting each example of injustice to specific biblical teachings or principles to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
