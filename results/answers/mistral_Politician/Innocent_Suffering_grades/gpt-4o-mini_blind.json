It correctly emphasizes the sanctity of human life and the importance of justice and protection for the vulnerable. However, it could have been enhanced by delving deeper into specific biblical examples and theological implications surrounding the concept of innocent blood. Additionally, a stronger connection to the atonement and the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the redemption of all humanity could have further enriched the answer."
