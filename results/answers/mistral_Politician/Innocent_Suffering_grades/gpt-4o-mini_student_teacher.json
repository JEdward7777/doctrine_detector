  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid understanding of the concept of 'innocent blood' in the Bible, emphasizing the sanctity of life and the importance of justice. They effectively connected the concept to the value of life being divine and rooted in the image of God. The student could have strengthened their answer by providing more specific examples or passages from the Bible that address innocent blood directly. Overall, a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a good grasp of the topic."
