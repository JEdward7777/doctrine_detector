The discussion of how responses to God can influence understanding of His will is insightful and respectful. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the unique Christian perspective regarding the impact of choices on the relationship with God and His plans. More specific references to Christian teachings and Scriptures could enhance the significance of obedience, faith, and worship in aligning with God's will."
