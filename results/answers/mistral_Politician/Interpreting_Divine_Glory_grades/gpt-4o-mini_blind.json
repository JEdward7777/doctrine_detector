However, it lacks depth and specificity in addressing the Christian understanding of divine glory within worship. To improve, the student could have focused more on the unique aspects of divine glory as understood in Christianity, such as the radiance and majesty of God's presence, His attributes of holiness and perfection, and the central role of worship in glorifying God. Emphasizing the importance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate manifestation of God's glory in the Christian faith would have strengthened the response."
