  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a solid understanding of interpreting the term \"Most High\" in religious contexts, focusing on divine sovereignty, singularity, omnipotence, and transcendence. They have correctly emphasized the metaphorical use of the term 'high' to signify greatness and authority rather than physical height, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The student's response is clear, articulate, and addresses the concern of avoiding misconceptions about God's nature effectively."
