# Question [Interpreting 'High' in God's Title](../../../questions/Interpreting__High__in_God_s_Title.md)
How should we interpret the term 'high' in the title 'Most High' when considering God's nature?

# Correct Answer
'High' refers to greatness and authority, not to physical height, emphasizing God's supremacy over everything.

# Stated Concern
It is important to avoid misconceptions about God's nature and to understand the metaphorical use of descriptive titles.

# Answer by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In religious and philosophical contexts, the term "Most High" often refers to a supreme, all-powerful deity. It signifies divine sovereignty rather than physical height or superiority. This phrase is commonly used in monotheistic traditions like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam to emphasize the singularity, omnipotence, and transcendence of God. Therefore, when interpreting "Most High" in religious contexts, it is important to acknowledge the connotations of supremacy, holiness, and divine authority rather than physical height or superiority as understood in a literal sense.
