However, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological and spiritual significance of the name within Christianity, such as its representation of God's chosen people and the fulfillment of His promises. Additionally, emphasizing the unique role of Israel in biblical prophecy and salvation history would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview."
