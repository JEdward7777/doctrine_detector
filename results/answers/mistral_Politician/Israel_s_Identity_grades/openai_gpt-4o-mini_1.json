  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the biblical significance of the name \"Israel\" as given by God to Jacob. It demonstrates an understanding of the meaning and context of biblical names. The additional information about the struggle with God and the transformation symbolized by the name change adds depth to the response and shows a good grasp of the significance of biblical names. However, there could have been a more explicit connection between the given answer and the broader context of biblical interpretations, which would have further strengthened the response."
