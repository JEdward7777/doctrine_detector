However, it lacks a clear Christian worldview perspective and fails to highlight the theological significance of this act, which goes beyond symbolic gestures and human compassion. Additionally, the answer could have delved deeper into the spiritual implications of how Jesus' suffering on the cross fulfills prophecy and redemption. It would benefit from incorporating more scriptural references to support the explanation."
