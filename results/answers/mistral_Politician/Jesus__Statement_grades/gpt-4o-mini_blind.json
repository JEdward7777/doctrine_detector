The answer lacks a clear Christian perspective in explaining Jesus as the source of eternal life and the power of resurrection. It also misses the opportunity to highlight the unique Christian belief in Jesus as the exclusive way to salvation, which is a foundational doctrine. Additionally, a clearer emphasis on the divinity of Jesus and the centrality of personal faith in him for salvation would have improved the response."
