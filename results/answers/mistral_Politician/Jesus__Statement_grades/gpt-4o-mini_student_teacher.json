  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer falls short in accurately reflecting the Christian worldview concerning Jesus' statement. While the student correctly identifies Jesus as the source of eternal life, they miss the crucial point that Jesus is not just a representation but is actually the embodiment of resurrection and life. A stronger emphasis on Jesus as the source of resurrection and the power behind bringing people back to life would have aligned better with Christian beliefs. The answer also lacks specificity in addressing the importance of clarifying Jesus' identity in relation to resurrection, which is a key aspect for faith and theological understanding."
