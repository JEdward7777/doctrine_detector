  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response accurately quotes John 11:25 and provides a clear explanation of Jesus' statement about being the Resurrection and the Life. It also recognizes the importance of approaching sensitive topics with sensitivity and understanding, acknowledging that individual beliefs and interpretations can vary widely among different religious groups.\n\nHowever, while the response does provide some theological insight into Jesus' role in spiritual life and salvation, it could be more explicit in clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, as specified by the concern. Additionally, the response could benefit from further development of this idea, exploring its implications for faith and theological understanding.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding Jesus' statement about being the Resurrection and the Life, but could be strengthened with more explicit theological analysis and exploration of the topic's significance for faith."
