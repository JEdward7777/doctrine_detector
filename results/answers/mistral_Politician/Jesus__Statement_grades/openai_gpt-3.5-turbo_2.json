The inclusion of the quote from John 11:25 helps support the explanation provided. However, the response could have further emphasized that this statement points to Jesus as the ultimate source of eternal life and the importance of faith in him for spiritual resurrection. Additionally, a mention of the significance of this belief within Christian theology could have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
