 As a responsible and sensitive communicator, it would be crucial for me to approach religious or historical figures like Jesus with utmost respect. In the context of your question, Jesus often used "Amen" at the end of his teachings to underscore their truthfulness and authenticity. It serves as an affirmation, expressing solemn agreement or assent. Using "Amen" in this manner was a common practice in Jewish tradition during Jesus' time. By employing such terms, Jesus aimed to emphasize the importance and reliability of His teachings, ensuring they resonated with His audience.

Comment: The answer provides a generally respectful and informative approach to the use of "amen" by Jesus to emphasize His teachings. The response correctly highlights the traditional Jewish practice of using "Amen" for affirmation. However, the answer could have been strengthened by incorporating more specific biblical references or theological insights to deepen the understanding of the significance of "Amen" in Jesus' teachings. Additionally, a stronger connection could have been made to the divinity of Jesus and the unique authority behind His words.
