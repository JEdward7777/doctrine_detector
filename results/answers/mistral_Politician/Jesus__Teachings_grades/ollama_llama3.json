  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a good understanding of Jesus' use of \"Amen\" in his teachings, highlighting its purpose as an affirmation and emphasis on truthfulness. It also acknowledges the cultural context of Jewish tradition during Jesus' time. The mention of Jesus aiming to emphasize the importance and reliability of His teachings is also relevant to the concern about recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples or Scriptural references to support its claims. Additionally, while it touches on the idea of emphasizing truthfulness, it does not directly address how this relates to recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' use of \"Amen\" but could benefit from more explicit connections to the concern about recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings."
