It acknowledges the authority of Jesus's words in Scripture by highlighting how He used \"Amen\" to introduce related teachings. The only minor improvement would be to explicitly mention the authority of Jesus as the Son of God, which is foundational in recognizing the significance of His teachings in Scripture."
