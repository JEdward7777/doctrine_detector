## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In religious discussions, especially within Christianity, Jesus is often referred to as the High Priest, specifically in reference to his role in the New Covenant. This is based on the Old Testament description of the High Priest who officiated in the Temple and made atonement for the sins of the people.

In the New Testament, however, Jesus' priesthood is not about offering physical sacrifices as human priests did in the Old Testament. Instead, his priesthood is one of intercession, where he mediates between God and humanity. The sacrifice that Jesus made was his own life on the cross, which serves as the ultimate atonement for all sins.

This shift from a human priest making physical sacrifices to Jesus as the High Priest means that the need for human priests to make physical sacrifices is no longer necessary. Instead, the focus shifts to following Jesus' teachings and living a life of love, compassion, and service to others. This concept is central to many Christian denominations, particularly those of Protestant background.

In terms of being politically correct, it is important to remember that these discussions involve deeply held religious beliefs. It is essential to approach such conversations with respect, understanding, and openness to different perspectives while acknowledging the diversity of interpretations within Christianity itself.
