  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of Jesus' role as the High Priest in the New Covenant and how his sacrifice replaces the need for human priests to make physical sacrifices. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood. However, the student could have incorporated more direct biblical references to enhance the answer further. Additionally, while the mention of political correctness is relevant in some contexts, it is not directly related to the theological discussion at hand."
