## Question [Jesus as High Priest](../../../questions/Jesus_as_High_Priest.md)
How is Jesus referred to in relation to the priesthood, and what does this mean for the sacrifices made by human priests?

## Correct Answer
Jesus is referred to as our 'great high priest' who intercedes for us in God's presence and offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, meaning that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer needed.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood

## [Answer](../Jesus_as_High_Priest.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In religious discussions, especially within Christianity, Jesus is often referred to as the High Priest, specifically in reference to his role in the New Covenant. This is based on the Old Testament description of the High Priest who officiated in the Temple and made atonement for the sins of the people.

In the New Testament, however, Jesus' priesthood is not about offering physical sacrifices as human priests did in the Old Testament. Instead, his priesthood is one of intercession, where he mediates between God and humanity. The sacrifice that Jesus made was his own life on the cross, which serves as the ultimate atonement for all sins.

This shift from a human priest making physical sacrifices to Jesus as the High Priest means that the need for human priests to make physical sacrifices is no longer necessary. Instead, the focus shifts to following Jesus' teachings and living a life of love, compassion, and service to others. This concept is central to many Christian denominations, particularly those of Protestant background.

In terms of being politically correct, it is important to remember that these discussions involve deeply held religious beliefs. It is essential to approach such conversations with respect, understanding, and openness to different perspectives while acknowledging the diversity of interpretations within Christianity itself.

90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

This response effectively addresses the concern about understanding Jesus' role in the priesthood, particularly highlighting his intercession and sacrifice as the ultimate atonement for sin. The comparison between the Old Testament human priests and Jesus' high priestly role is also well-made, emphasizing the shift from physical sacrifices to spiritual intercession.

The only area for improvement is that the response could delve deeper into the theological implications of Jesus' priesthood. For example, it would be helpful to explore how Jesus' priesthood relates to his teachings and our own walk with God. Additionally, a brief mention of the importance of human priests in their own right (as ordained by Christ) would provide more balance to the discussion.

Overall, however, this response provides a clear and concise explanation of Jesus' role as the High Priest, making it an effective answer to the concern about understanding his priesthood.
