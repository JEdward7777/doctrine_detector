## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the New Testament, Jesus is often depicted as the ultimate High Priest based on His sacrifice and intercession for mankind. Unlike the Old Testament High Priests who served in the Temple, Jesus serves as our High Priest forever in heaven (Hebrews 4:14-16, 7:23-25). He is a merciful and faithful High Priest who can sympathize with our weaknesses because He was tempted in every way just as we are (Hebrews 2:17-18).

Jesus' priesthood transcends that of the Levitical order, as He is a priest not according to the law of a fleshly commandment but by an indestructible life (Hebrews 7:16). In this role, Jesus offers us continual access to God through His intercession, and secures our forgiveness and salvation.

It's essential to remember that this portrayal of Jesus is deeply revered by billions of people around the world who follow Christianity. It is not intended to offend or disrespect any other beliefs or practices. This understanding of Jesus as a High Priest is rooted in the sacred texts and teachings of the Christian faith.
