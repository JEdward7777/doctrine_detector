The integration of relevant Bible verses from Hebrews supports the argument effectively. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of how Jesus' priesthood transcends the Levitical order and offers continual access to God for forgiveness and salvation. The response aligns well with Christian beliefs and shows respect for the theological significance of Jesus as the Great High Priest. Well done!"
