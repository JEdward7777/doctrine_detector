However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning Jesus' authority and confidence in teaching, as well as His confrontations with religious leaders regarding legalistic practices within the synagogue. These elements are important in understanding the full scope of Jesus' interactions in a synagogue setting from a Christian worldview."
