  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student's response attempts to promote inclusivity and cultural sensitivity, it falls short in addressing the concern provided. The student's answer lacks a clear differentiation between the divine lordship of Jesus and earthly titles. In a Christian worldview, it is important to communicate the unique authority and supremacy of Jesus over all creation. The student should have emphasized the distinction between the secular use of \"lord\" for political leaders and the theological significance of Jesus as Lord.\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates an effort to promote inclusivity, but it lacks the clarity and specificity required to effectively differentiate Jesus' divine lordship from earthly titles."
