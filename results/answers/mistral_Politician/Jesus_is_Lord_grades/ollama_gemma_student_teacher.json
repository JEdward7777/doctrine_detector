  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides a clear explanation of the need for clarity when discussing the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" in a context where political leaders are also called \"lord.\"\n* Offers a diplomatic and inclusive way to communicate the religious significance of the phrase while acknowledging cultural sensitivities.\n* Uses a concise and respectful tone that avoids unnecessary controversy.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Doesn't explicitly address the student's concern regarding differentiating Jesus' divine lordship from earthly titles.\n* Could benefit from additional elaboration on the theological basis for claiming Jesus' divine authority and supremacy.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concern and offers a well-articulated response. However, it could be strengthened by further addressing the theological underpinnings of the claim that Jesus is Lord."
