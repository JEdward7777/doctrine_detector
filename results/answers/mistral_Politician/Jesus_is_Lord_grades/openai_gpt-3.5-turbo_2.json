While the original response emphasized inclusivity and cultural sensitivity, it fell short of explicitly addressing the concern raised in a Christian-specific worldview context. To improve, the response could have more clearly emphasized the unique and divine authority of Jesus as Lord in contrast to earthly rulers."
