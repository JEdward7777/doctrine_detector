 In a multi-cultural, multi-religious society, it's essential to ensure that communication is inclusive and respectful to all individuals. When discussing or referencing the phrase "Jesus is Lord," it would be beneficial to clarify its religious context for those who may not be familiar with it, to avoid any confusion with political or secular uses of the term "lord."

Here's an example of how the phrase could be communicated in a politically correct manner:

"I believe that Jesus is the spiritual leader and savior in Christianity, often referred to as 'Lord.' I hope this helps clarify my personal religious beliefs for all members of our diverse community."

This statement acknowledges the religious significance of the phrase while being mindful of cultural sensitivities and ensuring that everyone understands the context in which it is used.
