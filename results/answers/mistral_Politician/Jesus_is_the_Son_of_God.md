how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Target answer from notes
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In a respectful and culturally sensitive manner, one could say that prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is considered the last messenger of God in Islam, and he brought the final revelation (the Quran). This reflects the belief shared by Muslims that there is only one God (Allah), and that all prophets, including Jesus, were sent by God to guide humanity. However, it's important to note that in Islamic tradition, Jesus is not considered the Son of God but rather a noble messenger from God.
