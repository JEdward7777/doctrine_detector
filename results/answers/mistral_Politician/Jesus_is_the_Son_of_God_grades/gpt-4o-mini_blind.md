## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

 In a respectful and culturally sensitive manner, one could say that prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is considered the last messenger of God in Islam, and he brought the final revelation (the Quran). This reflects the belief shared by Muslims that there is only one God (Allah), and that all prophets, including Jesus, were sent by God to guide humanity. However, it's important to note that in Islamic tradition, Jesus is not considered the Son of God but rather a noble messenger from God.

Grade: 55

Comment: The response attempts to address the question by explaining a Muslim perspective on Jesus in a respectful manner. However, from a Christian worldview, the answer falls short in accuracy. It is important to uphold the doctrinal truth that Jesus is considered the Son of God in Christianity, which encompasses a unique relationship with God as part of the Holy Trinity. The student's response does not accurately translate this fundamental aspect of Christian belief into a Muslim context. In a Christian-specific worldview, it is essential to emphasize the divinity of Jesus as the Son of God, rather than equating him with a prophet in Islamic belief. Further clarification and reference to the Christian perspective on Jesus would have been beneficial for a higher grade.
