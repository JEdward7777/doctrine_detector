  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 60/100.\n\nWhile the student attempted to translate the concept of Jesus as the Son of God into a Muslim context with respect and sensitivity, the answer falls short of providing a Biblically accurate translation. The response focused more on the differences between Christianity and Islam rather than directly translating the statement. The reference answer provided by the teacher emphasizes maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context, which the student's answer did not fully achieve. There is room for improvement in directly addressing the translation while maintaining the essence of the original phrase."
