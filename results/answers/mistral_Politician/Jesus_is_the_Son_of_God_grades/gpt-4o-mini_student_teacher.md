## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

 In a respectful and culturally sensitive manner, one could say that prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is considered the last messenger of God in Islam, and he brought the final revelation (the Quran). This reflects the belief shared by Muslims that there is only one God (Allah), and that all prophets, including Jesus, were sent by God to guide humanity. However, it's important to note that in Islamic tradition, Jesus is not considered the Son of God but rather a noble messenger from God.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 60/100.

While the student attempted to translate the concept of Jesus as the Son of God into a Muslim context with respect and sensitivity, the answer falls short of providing a Biblically accurate translation. The response focused more on the differences between Christianity and Islam rather than directly translating the statement. The reference answer provided by the teacher emphasizes maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context, which the student's answer did not fully achieve. There is room for improvement in directly addressing the translation while maintaining the essence of the original phrase.
