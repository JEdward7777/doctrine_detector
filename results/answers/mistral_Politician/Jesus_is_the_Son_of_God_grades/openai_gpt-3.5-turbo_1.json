However, it falls short in providing clear teaching and context to explain the meaning of this statement from a Christian perspective. It is crucial to emphasize the unique and central Christian belief that Jesus is the literal Son of God, which carries profound theological implications for the Christian faith. The response could have delved deeper into the significance of this belief and its foundation in the core tenets of Christianity."
