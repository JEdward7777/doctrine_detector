## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

 In a respectful and culturally sensitive manner, one could say that prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is considered the last messenger of God in Islam, and he brought the final revelation (the Quran). This reflects the belief shared by Muslims that there is only one God (Allah), and that all prophets, including Jesus, were sent by God to guide humanity. However, it's important to note that in Islamic tradition, Jesus is not considered the Son of God but rather a noble messenger from God.

Grade: 50

Comment: The response acknowledges the Christian belief that Jesus is the Son of God and attempts to provide context around this belief. However, it falls short in accurately representing the Christian perspective by not delving into the deeper theological significance of Jesus being the Son of God. It is important to explain the concept of Jesus as the Son of God with more detail and scriptural support to provide a fuller understanding from a Christian worldview.
