## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

 In a respectful and culturally sensitive manner, one could say that prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is considered the last messenger of God in Islam, and he brought the final revelation (the Quran). This reflects the belief shared by Muslims that there is only one God (Allah), and that all prophets, including Jesus, were sent by God to guide humanity. However, it's important to note that in Islamic tradition, Jesus is not considered the Son of God but rather a noble messenger from God.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a respectful and culturally sensitive explanation of Islamic beliefs regarding Prophet Muhammad and Jesus, emphasizing monotheism and the role of prophets. However, it fails to address the concern raised about accurately translating and explaining the phrase "Jesus is the Son of God" in a Biblically accurate and appropriate manner from a Christian perspective. More focus on providing clear teaching and context from a Christian worldview would have strengthened the response.
