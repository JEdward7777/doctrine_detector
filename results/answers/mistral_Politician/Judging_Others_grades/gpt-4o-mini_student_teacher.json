  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer incorporating various biblical references and interpretations regarding judgment among Christians. They highlighted the balance between not harshly judging others and the importance of correcting in love. While the student could have focused more on the specific instruction of encouraging and supporting each other's growth in faith as mentioned in Luke 6:37, overall, they showed a thorough understanding of the biblical teachings on judgment within the Christian community."
