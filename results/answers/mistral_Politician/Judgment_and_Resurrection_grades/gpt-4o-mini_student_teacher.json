  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer detailing various events associated with the Day of Yahweh or Day of the Lord, including judgment, restoration, cosmic disturbances, the return of God's people, and the universal reign of God. The response shows a good understanding of the eschatological significance of this period in Christian belief. However, the answer could be stronger if it more directly aligned with the teacher's reference answer, which emphasizes judgment of sinners, resurrection, and the permanent establishment of the Lord's rule. Overall, a well-informed and respectful response."
