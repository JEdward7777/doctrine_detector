## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politically correct politician, it's important to promote harmony, understanding, and respect among all individuals. In this spirit, I'd like to share a relevant message from Jesus that addresses the topic of pointing out the faults of others, taking into account our own shortcomings.

In the Bible (Matthew 7:1-5), Jesus teaches: "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way as you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?"

This passage emphasizes that before we point out the faults of others, it's crucial to consider and address our own flaws first. By doing so, we can foster an environment of empathy, tolerance, and personal growth – promoting unity among people from all walks of life. In essence, by focusing on ourselves and striving for self-improvement, we can contribute positively to a more inclusive society.
