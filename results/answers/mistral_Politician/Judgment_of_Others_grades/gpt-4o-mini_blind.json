  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer addresses part of the biblical teaching about not judging others without addressing the full context of Jesus' words. The student uses language that focuses more on promoting harmony and unity among individuals rather than emphasizing the importance of personal repentance and spiritual growth in relation to pointing out faults. The mention of being a politically correct politician is not aligned with the Christian worldview when discussing teachings from Jesus. The response lacks depth in conveying the Christian perspective on this topic. Consider including more theological depth and emphasizing the need for humility and self-reflection in light of Jesus' teachings."
