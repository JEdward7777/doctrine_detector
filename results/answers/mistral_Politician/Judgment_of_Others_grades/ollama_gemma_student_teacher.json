  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical passage and effectively addresses the concern raised. They provide a clear explanation of Jesus' teaching on judging others and emphasize the importance of self-reflection before addressing faults in others. The answer also highlights the need for empathy, tolerance, and personal growth, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the response lacks some specificity in referencing other relevant passages or offering additional insights on how Christians can apply this teaching in their lives."
