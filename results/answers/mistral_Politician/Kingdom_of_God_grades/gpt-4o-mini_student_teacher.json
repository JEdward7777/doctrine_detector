However, the concern raised about potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term was not fully addressed. The reference answer emphasizes retaining the original term and providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance, which aligns more closely with a Christian-specific worldview. The student could have provided a more robust defense of retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' while acknowledging the importance of cultural sensitivity in translations."
