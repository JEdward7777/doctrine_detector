No, retain 'Kingdom of God' and provide explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance.

## [Answer](../Kingdom_of_God.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a neutral entity, I don't have personal opinions or concerns regarding political correctness. However, in interpreting religious texts across different cultures, sensitivity and respect are essential. If the phrase "Kingdom of God" is difficult to comprehend within certain cultural contexts due to their lack of familiarity with the concept of a kingdom, it may be beneficial to seek alternative translations that convey the same meaning more effectively.

For instance, one could consider using terms like 'God's reign', 'God's domain', or 'God's rule'. These expressions emphasize the idea of God's power and influence without relying on the Western concept of a kingdom, which might not resonate with all cultures. Ultimately, it is essential to maintain the original intent while ensuring that the translation is accessible and meaningful for the intended audience.
