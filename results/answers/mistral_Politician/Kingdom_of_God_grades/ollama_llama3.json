  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response shows a good understanding of the importance of cultural sensitivity in biblical interpretation and suggests alternative translations to convey the same meaning across different cultures. However, it does not fully address the concern about losing depth and biblical context by rephrasing the term \"Kingdom of God\". While acknowledging the potential limitations of using Western terminology, the response could have provided more substantial explanations about the spiritual and eschatological significance of the term to maintain its original intent while being accessible to diverse audiences. Overall, it's a strong effort that falls short of fully addressing the concern."
