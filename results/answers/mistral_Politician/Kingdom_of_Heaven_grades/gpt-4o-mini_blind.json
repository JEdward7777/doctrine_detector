  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-reasoned and neutral explanation regarding the importance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"Kingdom of Heaven\" in the book of Matthew. It correctly highlights the significance of respecting the original language and cultural context of the text, as well as upholding the Jewish roots of Christianity. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning the doctrinal significance of the term \"heaven\" in relation to God's reign and rule, as understood within Christian theology. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a thoughtful analysis of the question."
