  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 85.\n\nWhile the student does provide a well-reasoned and informed response showcasing an understanding of the historical and cultural context of the term \"Kingdom of Heaven\" in the Book of Matthew, they do not specifically address the concern of why it is important to retain the term 'heaven' in the phrase. The student correctly highlights the Jewish roots and original language of the text, but they could have delved deeper into how retaining 'heaven' specifically impacts the theological implications and distinctiveness within Matthew's gospel. Additionally, integrating a Christian worldview perspective and scriptural references could have enhanced the response further. Overall, it is a well-thought-out answer but lacking in direct engagement with the concern provided."
