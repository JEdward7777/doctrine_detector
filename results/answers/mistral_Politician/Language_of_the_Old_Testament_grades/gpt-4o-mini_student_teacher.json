  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a thorough understanding of the languages used in the Old Testament and accurately identified Hebrew as the primary language. Additionally, they acknowledged the presence of Aramaic in certain sections, showing a comprehensive grasp of the topic. However, the mention of Classical Hebrew and its historical development adds depth to their answer. Overall, an excellent response that is well-informed and detailed."
