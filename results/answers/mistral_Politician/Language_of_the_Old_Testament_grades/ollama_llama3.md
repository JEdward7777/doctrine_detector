## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 The vast majority of the Hebrew Bible, which corresponds to the Old Testament in Christian scriptures, was written in Biblical Hebrew (also known as Classical Hebrew or Ancient Hebrew). This is a form of the Northwest Semitic language that emerged as the language of the ancient Israelites and became the liturgical language of Second Temple Judaism. However, it's important to note that parts of the Old Testament also contain sections written in Aramaic, such as the Book of Jonah and the Book of Daniel.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response generally agrees with the correct answer, stating that "the vast majority of the Hebrew Bible... was written in Biblical Hebrew". This shows a good understanding of the language of the Old Testament and its historical context. The additional information about Aramaic sections is also relevant and accurate.

However, I deduct 10 points because the response does not explicitly confirm that "the vast majority" of the Old Testament is written in Hebrew, whereas the correct answer states this more directly. Nevertheless, the response provides a good overview of the language context and historical background of the Old Testament, which is essential for studying the Scriptures.

Comment: This grade reflects the response's overall accuracy and relevance to the concern about understanding the original context of Scripture. While not as direct as the correct answer, it still provides valuable information that can aid in this pursuit.
