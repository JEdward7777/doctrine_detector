## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 The vast majority of the Hebrew Bible, which corresponds to the Old Testament in Christian scriptures, was written in Biblical Hebrew (also known as Classical Hebrew or Ancient Hebrew). This is a form of the Northwest Semitic language that emerged as the language of the ancient Israelites and became the liturgical language of Second Temple Judaism. However, it's important to note that parts of the Old Testament also contain sections written in Aramaic, such as the Book of Jonah and the Book of Daniel.

Comment: The response accurately affirms that the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, aligning with the Christian understanding of the Hebrew Bible. Understanding the original languages in which the Scriptures were written is indeed essential for studying the Bible and grasping its authentic historical and cultural context. The only minor improvement could be expanding on the significance of knowing the original languages for a deeper understanding of the Old Testament.
