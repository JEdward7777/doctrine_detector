It also effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of local fellowship among believers, highlighting various aspects such as shared meals, prayer, and teaching. However, while it provides a good overview of the characteristics of these gatherings, it could be further developed to more explicitly encourage local fellowship among believers. The response does an excellent job of showcasing the biblical basis for these early Christian practices, which is a significant aspect of fostering local fellowship."
