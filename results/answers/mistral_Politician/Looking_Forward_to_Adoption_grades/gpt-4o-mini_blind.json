The explanation of the \"adoption\" as believers becoming children of God and the future redemption of their bodies in line with Galatians 4:5 and 1 Corinthians 15:42-49 is doctrinally accurate. However, it could have been strengthened by emphasizing the role of God's grace through faith in Christ as the basis for this adoption, and by connecting the believer's struggle against sin with the need for reliance on the Holy Spirit in sanctification. Additionally, a more explicit mention of the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection in securing this future hope for believers would have been beneficial."
