  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-reasoned interpretation of Romans 8:23 in discussing the struggle against sin, the future redemption of believers' bodies, and the ultimate adoption as children of God. However, there was a missed opportunity to emphasize the full realization of adoption in the future and the significance of believers receiving their glorified bodies. The response demonstrated understanding of the passage within its context but could have more explicitly highlighted the hope and future aspect of being adopted into God's family as the reference answer did."
