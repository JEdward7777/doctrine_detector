 The Lord's Supper, also known as Holy Communion or Eucharist, commemorates a significant event in Christian faith: the institution of the sacrament by Jesus Christ during the Last Supper with his apostles. In this event, Jesus broke bread and shared wine to symbolize his body and blood, which he commanded his followers to remember him until his return. It is an important ritual practiced in many Christian denominations as a way of remembering the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and strengthening their faith.
