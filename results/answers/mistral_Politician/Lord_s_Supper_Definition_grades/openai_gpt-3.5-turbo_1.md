 The Lord's Supper, also known as Holy Communion or Eucharist, commemorates a significant event in Christian faith: the institution of the sacrament by Jesus Christ during the Last Supper with his apostles. In this event, Jesus broke bread and shared wine to symbolize his body and blood, which he commanded his followers to remember him until his return. It is an important ritual practiced in many Christian denominations as a way of remembering the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and strengthening their faith.

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian faith, specifically connecting it to the Passover meal Jesus shared with his disciples. It effectively conveys the sacrificial aspect of Jesus' body and blood in the context of sin atonement. The only slight deduction in points is due to the response not explicitly mentioning the command to remember Jesus until his return, which further highlights the ongoing importance of the Lord's Supper in the Christian faith.
