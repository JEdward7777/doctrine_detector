They highlighted key verses and connected forgiveness to God's character and the promotion of healthy relationships. The response effectively addresses the concern of encouraging forgiveness as a reflection of God's love in daily interactions. The answer could have been improved by focusing more directly on the aspect of forgiveness reflecting God's unconditional love for us, as highlighted in the reference answer."
