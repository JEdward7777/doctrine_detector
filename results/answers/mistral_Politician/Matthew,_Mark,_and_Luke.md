## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the New Testament of the Bible, the names of the Twelve Disciples are mentioned in three different books: Matthew (10:2-4; 13:17; 16:18; 17:1; 20:20), Mark (3:13-19) and Luke (6:13-16). In all these accounts, the disciples are listed as follows:

  1. Simon Peter
  2. Andrew his brother
  3. James the son of Zebedee
  4. John his brother
  5. Philip
  6. Bartholomew (also called Nathanael)
  7. Thomas
  8. Matthew the tax collector
  9. James the son of Alphaeus
 10. Thaddaeus (also called Lebbaeus or Judas, son of James or Judas son of James)
 11. Simon the Zealot
 12. Judas Iscariot (the disciple who betrayed Jesus)

It is worth noting that depending on various translations and interpretations, the names of the Twelve Disciples may be listed in slightly different orders, and there may be some variations in the names for certain disciples. For example, Thaddaeus might be referred to as Judas (not Iscariot) or Lebbaeus, and Bartholomew is sometimes identified with Nathanael. Nevertheless, the above list represents the most common sequence found in the majority of Bible translations.
