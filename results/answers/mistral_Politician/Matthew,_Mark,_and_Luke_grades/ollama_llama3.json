  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response is generally accurate, stating that the names of the Twelve Disciples are mentioned in three different books: Matthew, Mark, and Luke. However, it could be improved by providing more specific details about the accounts and their teachings, as per the concern specified. For instance, the response could have highlighted how these accounts provide insight into the characters and relationships among the disciples, or how they illustrate Jesus' teaching methods and interactions with his followers. Nevertheless, the response shows a good understanding of the biblical texts and their harmony on this topic."
