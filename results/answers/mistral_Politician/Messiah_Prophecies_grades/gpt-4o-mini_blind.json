The emphasis on political correctness and sensitivity to diverse beliefs detracts from the clarity and conviction expected in a Christian perspective. The student should strive to present the fulfillment of these prophecies in a more direct and doctrinally sound manner without diluting the significance of Jesus as the promised Messiah."
