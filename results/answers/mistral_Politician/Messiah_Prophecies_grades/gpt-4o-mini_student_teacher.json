The answer leans more towards a politically correct and inclusive approach rather than focusing on the central theme of the question regarding faith and fulfillment of prophecies. Encouraging open dialogue and respect for diverse beliefs is important, but in a Christian worldview context, acknowledging the fulfillment of these prophecies by Jesus is crucial for understanding the significance of His role as the Messiah."
