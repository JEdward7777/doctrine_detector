There is a missed opportunity to clearly present the Christian perspective on the Messiah and how it distinguishes Jesus from other religious savior figures, as well as a lack of alignment with the concern about staying true to scripture. The response focuses more on universal principles rather than on the specific teachings of Christianity regarding Jesus as the Messiah."
