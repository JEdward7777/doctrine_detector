However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern by not providing clear teaching on Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and His unique role as the Savior. In a Christian worldview, it is crucial to differentiate Jesus from other religious savior figures and stay true to Scripture, which this response does not prioritize."
