However, from a Christian perspective, the answer falls short in emphasizing the theological significance of Jesus being the Messiah. It is important to highlight Jesus' unique role as the promised Savior, the Son of God, who came to fulfill the prophecies and redeem humanity through his sacrificial death and resurrection. The response could further integrate biblical references and teachings to strengthen the connection between Jesus as the Messiah and the title \"King of the Jews.\""
