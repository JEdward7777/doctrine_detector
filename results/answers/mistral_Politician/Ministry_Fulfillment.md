1. Promoting love and unity by fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
2. Practicing integrity and transparency in all actions, ensuring that decisions are guided by moral principles and ethical values.

4. Encouraging compassion and empathy by addressing social and economic issues that impact vulnerable communities.
5. Collaborating with diverse faith-based organizations to address shared concerns and work towards common goals.
