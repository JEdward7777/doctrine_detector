4. Encouraging compassion and empathy by addressing social and economic issues that impact vulnerable communities.
5. Collaborating with diverse faith-based organizations to address shared concerns and work towards common goals.
6. Serving the greater good through selfless action, putting the needs of others before personal gain or political ambition.

Ultimately, fulfilling my ministry as a Christian means using the platform provided by public office to serve others selflessly, promote love and justice, and strive to make our society a better place for everyone. This requires constant reflection, introspection, and dedication to the ideals and values that define us as Christians.
