The answer should have emphasized the biblical understanding of miracles as signs pointing to the reality of God's existence and His interaction with humanity, rather than presenting miracles as subjective experiences or events open to various interpretations. Additionally, the answer lacks reference to specific Christian teachings or scripture, which are essential in discussing miracles and belief in God from a Christian perspective."
