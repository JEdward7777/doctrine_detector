However, the answer lacks a clear Christian-specific viewpoint on the role of miracles in leading others to faith. The reference answer emphasizes that miracles validate the ministry of prophets and apostles, pointing to God's power as the ultimate source. Encouraging the student to incorporate more theological insights from a Christian perspective would strengthen their answer in addressing the concern provided."
