  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of miracles and their potential role in leading others to faith. It acknowledges the diversity of perspectives on this topic, which shows an effort to understand and respect different viewpoints. The response also highlights the significance of personal experiences and stories in strengthening one's faith.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response falls short of fully addressing the concern:\n\n1. While the response mentions that miracles can \"function as signs that lead to belief in God,\" it does not explicitly state how these signs serve as indicators of God's power or validate the ministry of prophets and apostles.\n2. The response focuses more on the diversity of perspectives and respect for different viewpoints, but it does not delve deeper into the role of miracles in evangelism and personal faith.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected the concept of miracles to the concern about leading others to faith."
