  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a well-researched and informative response on the cultural and historical significance of myrrh, they missed the primary Christian-specific viewpoint of its symbolism in relation to Jesus' future suffering and sacrificial death. The student's answer focused more on the general historical context and symbolism from a cultural perspective rather than delving into the Christian interpretation of myrrh as a gift to Jesus. To deepen appreciation of Jesus' purpose and mission, it is crucial to emphasize the Christian significance of myrrh in this context."
