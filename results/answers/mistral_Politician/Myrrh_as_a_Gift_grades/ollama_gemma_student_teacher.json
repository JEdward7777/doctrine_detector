  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comments:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the symbolic significance of myrrh as one of the gifts given to Jesus. \n- The student correctly highlights the cultural and historical significance of myrrh in the Near East.\n- The explanation of myrrh's use in embalming connects it to the prophecies of Jesus' death and resurrection.\n- The connection between the gifts and the Magi's cultural backgrounds adds nuance to the interpretation. \n- The conclusion effectively emphasizes the richness of cultural traditions.\n\nHowever, the grade could be slightly higher if the student had directly addressed the concern related to the deeper appreciation of Jesus' purpose and mission through understanding the symbolism of the gifts."
