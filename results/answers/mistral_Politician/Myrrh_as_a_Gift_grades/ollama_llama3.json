While the answer mentions that myrrh represented Jesus' future suffering and death, the response could be more explicit in its connection to his purpose and mission. The provided response also focuses more on the cultural significance of myrrh rather than its symbolic meaning in relation to Jesus' life and sacrifice. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of myrrh's importance but could benefit from further exploration of its symbolism in relation to Jesus' purpose and mission."
