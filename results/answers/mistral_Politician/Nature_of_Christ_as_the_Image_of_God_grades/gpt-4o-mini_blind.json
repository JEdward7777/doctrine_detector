However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the foundational Christian doctrine that Jesus is not merely symbolically or metaphorically the image of God, but ontologically and uniquely as the Son of God. Additionally, the answer would benefit from a deeper exploration of the theological implications of Jesus being the image of God, especially in terms of redemption and salvation."
