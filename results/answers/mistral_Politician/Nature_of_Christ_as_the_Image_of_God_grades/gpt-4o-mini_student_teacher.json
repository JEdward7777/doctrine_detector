  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how Jesus is described as the image of God in Christianity, touching on key theological concepts and referencing relevant scripture. However, the student's response falls short from a Christian worldview perspective as it leans more towards a symbolic or metaphorical interpretation rather than acknowledging Jesus's full divinity and essence shared with God the Father as central to the Christian belief. It is important to emphasize the core Christian doctrine of Jesus being God incarnate, distinct from simply being a symbol of God or embodying His attributes."
