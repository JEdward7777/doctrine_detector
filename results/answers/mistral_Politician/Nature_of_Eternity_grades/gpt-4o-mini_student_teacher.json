  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student accurately describes eternity as an endless duration without limit, linking it with God and the promise of eternal life through salvation in Jesus Christ. The student also acknowledges the variations in interpretation within Christian denominations, which shows an understanding of the complexity of the concept within Christianity. However, the student's answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the eternal separation from God as part of the Christian belief about eternity, as highlighted in the reference answer. This aspect is crucial for Christians to grasp the full implications of their choices in this life."
