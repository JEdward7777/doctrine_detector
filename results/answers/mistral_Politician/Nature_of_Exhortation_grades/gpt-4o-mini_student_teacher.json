  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that aligns well with Christian teachings on exhortation in the New Testament, emphasizing love, compassion, humility, truthfulness, patience, gentleness, reverence, and wisdom. However, the answer seemed to focus more on general principles of exhortation rather than specifically addressing how Christians should approach it according to the teachings of the New Testament. The student could have provided more direct references to specific New Testament passages that address exhortation. Additionally, the answer could have been more concise and directly tied back to the core teaching of exhorting in love."
