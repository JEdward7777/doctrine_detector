  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the concept of God as spirit and its implications for worship, emphasizing the importance of spiritual connection and authenticity in worship. However, it falls short in clearly articulating the unique Christian perspective on this topic, such as the Trinitarian nature of God and the centrality of Jesus Christ in our relationship with God. Additionally, the response could have included more scriptural references and doctrinal teachings to strengthen the theological foundation of the explanation."
