  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written response that demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of God as a spirit and its implications for worship. The student effectively explains the intangible nature of God and the importance of spiritual connection in worship. The response also emphasizes the need for sincerity and authenticity in worship. However, the student's answer could have been stronger by directly addressing the necessity of spiritual engagement over physical rituals in worship, as highlighted in the reference answer. Encouraging more explicit connections between the essence of God as spirit and the practical implications for worship would have strengthened the response."
