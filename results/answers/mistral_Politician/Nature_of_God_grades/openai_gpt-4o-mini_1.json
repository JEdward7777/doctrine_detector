It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of spiritual engagement over physical rituals, aligning well with a Christian worldview that emphasizes a personal relationship with God. The response could have further emphasized the role of Jesus as the intermediary between God and humanity, but overall, it offers a strong foundation for understanding and approaching worship in a Christian context."
