  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a general overview of the concept of Hell in Christianity, touching on key points such as suffering, separation from God, and consequences for sin. However, their response lacks depth and fails to emphasize the severity and purpose of Hell in alignment with the Christian worldview. The student's explanation could be improved by focusing more on the biblical teachings of eternal punishment and the importance of accepting Jesus for salvation."
