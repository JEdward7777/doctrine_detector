  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nThe student accurately described Judgment Day in a Christian context according to the Bible, mentioning its significance as the final day of accounting for every person's life. They correctly identified that on Judgment Day, God judges people based on their deeds and faith, with the righteous going to Heaven and the wicked facing eternal separation from God in Hell. The answer also acknowledges the variations in interpretations among different Christian denominations.\n\nThe only minor concern is that the student could have emphasized the centrality of faith in Jesus Christ as the key determinant for one's eternal destiny on Judgment Day, aligning it more closely with the reference answer's focus on faith in Jesus."
