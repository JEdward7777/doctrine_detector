They acknowledge the diverse perspectives on the miracles of Jesus while also presenting the perspective of those who believe they are evidence of His divinity. The student's conclusion appropriately highlights that the miracles support Jesus' claims about His unique relationship with God and His divinity. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit statement that the miracles affirm Jesus' divine nature."
