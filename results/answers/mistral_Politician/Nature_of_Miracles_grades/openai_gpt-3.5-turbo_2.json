There is also an emphasis on respecting diverse perspectives on these events and fostering understanding and tolerance, which aligns with Christian values of love and acceptance. However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly highlighting the foundational belief in the Christian faith that Jesus's miracles serve as evidence of His divinity, without equivocating their historical significance."
