However, the response also highlights the diverse perspectives and interpretations of these miracles throughout history, which may dilute the emphasis on the central Christian belief that these miracles reveal Jesus as God and the Messiah. The importance of acknowledging the miracles as historical facts to affirm His divinity could be emphasized more strongly from a Christian worldview perspective."
