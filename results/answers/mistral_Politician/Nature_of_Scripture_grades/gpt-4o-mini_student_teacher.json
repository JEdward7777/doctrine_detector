  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of the connection between \"Scripture\" and \"the Word of God\" in the biblical context, highlighting the divine origin and authority of the sacred texts. The answer also acknowledges the importance of interpreting Scripture respectfully within diverse religious perspectives. However, the student's answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning that the term \"Word of God\" can extend beyond written scriptures to include messages delivered by Jesus, as stated in the reference answer."
