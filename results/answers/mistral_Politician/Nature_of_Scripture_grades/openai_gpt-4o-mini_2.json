It appropriately explains that the term \"scripture\" encompasses the Hebrew scriptures and how the \"word of God\" can include both written texts and messages delivered by Jesus. The response could have further emphasized the distinctiveness and authority of the Bible as the inspired Word of God, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern with clarity and accuracy from a Christian perspective."
