  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 50.\n\nWhile the student does provide a thorough explanation of the sources of temptation from both psychological and religious perspectives, the response fails to specifically address the Christian perspective on the role of our sinful nature and external influences in temptation. The student's answer lacks a clear alignment with the Christian teaching that our sinful nature drives us to desire what is wrong, and external influences can entice us to sin, as stated in the reference answer. Additionally, the student's focus on inclusivity and understanding in a political context may dilute the Christian-specific analysis that is expected in responding to the concern provided. The student could improve the grade by integrating more explicit references to Christian teachings on temptation."
