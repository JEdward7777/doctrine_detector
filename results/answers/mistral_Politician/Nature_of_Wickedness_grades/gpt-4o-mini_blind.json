  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the Bible's perspective on wickedness and the consequences of acting wickedly. The inclusion of relevant biblical references adds depth to the response. However, the student's approach lacks a clear personal integration of a Christian worldview, coming across as more academic than faith-based. To improve, the student could have connected the concept of wickedness more explicitly to the need for repentance and salvation through Christ, highlighting the importance of faith in God's forgiveness and transformative power."
