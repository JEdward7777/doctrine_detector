  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the biblical perspective on wickedness and the consequences for individuals who engage in immoral actions. It addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding these perspectives can influence moral behavior and spiritual growth. The reference to forgiveness, redemption, and the possibility of change also adds depth to the analysis. The only improvement would be to further emphasize the transformative power of God's grace and the importance of repentance in achieving spiritual growth."
