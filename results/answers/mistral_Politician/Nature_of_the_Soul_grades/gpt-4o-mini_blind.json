  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the biblical understanding of the terms \"soul\" and \"spirit.\" The student demonstrates a solid grasp of the distinction between the two concepts and provides relevant scriptural references to support their explanation. However, the response could have further emphasized the centrality of the spirit in connecting with God and the eternal significance of this relationship. Additionally, the student could have elaborated more on the implications of sanctifying one's spirit in relation to biblical teachings on holiness and spiritual growth. Overall, a well-rounded response but with room for deeper theological exploration."
