  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and detailed explanation of the biblical concepts of \"soul\" and \"spirit,\" showing a good understanding of the distinction between the two terms. However, the grade is slightly lower as the student did not address the concern of the biblical definitions ensuring accurate interpretation of scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God as explicitly highlighted in the prompt. The response could have been improved by emphasizing the importance of understanding these definitions in relation to interpreting biblical teachings and deepening one's relationship with God."
