  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical concepts of soul and spirit, providing accurate definitions and clear examples from scripture. The explanation of the distinction between the physical and spiritual aspects of a person is well-articulated and aligns with Christian theology. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the interchangeable use of the terms \"soul\" and \"spirit\" in certain contexts, as suggested in the reference answer."
