  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as described in Numbers 6:1-4. The student effectively outlines the restrictions of abstinence from wine and strong drink, avoidance of grapes, abstinence from cutting the hair, and separation from the dead. The explanation is thorough and well-supported with references to the biblical text. The student also appropriately contextualizes the ancient Jewish tradition of the Nazirite vow. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of these restrictions in demonstrating complete dedication to God and set apart for a special purpose within the Jewish religious context."
