  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good explanation of the significance of the New Covenant established through Jesus from a respectful and inclusive perspective. However, the answer lacks a deep dive into the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises, as the concern highlighted. The answer could have delved more into how Jesus' sacrifice brings about forgiveness of sins and a new relationship with God, emphasizing the transformative nature of this act in fulfilling God's promises."
