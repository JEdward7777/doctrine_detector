## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the New Testament, Christians are encouraged to study and understand the Old Testament books, including the Psalms, as they provide wisdom, guidance, and prophetic foreshadowing of Jesus Christ. However, it's important to note that the New Testament does not directly instruct Christians to follow the Psalms in a prescriptive or literal sense, as many of its verses were written within a specific cultural and historical context. Instead, the Psalms serve as a source of inspiration, prayer, and reflection for believers.

In 1 Peter 2:25, it states, "For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls." This verse can be connected with Psalm 23: "The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters."

Another example can be found in Matthew 22:37-40, where Jesus quotes from Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18, which are rooted in the teachings of the Old Testament Psalms regarding love for God and one's neighbor.

In summary, while the New Testament does not provide specific instructions for following the Psalms as a rulebook, it encourages Christians to learn from and apply their teachings to their lives, focusing on themes such as love, faith, and obedience to God.
