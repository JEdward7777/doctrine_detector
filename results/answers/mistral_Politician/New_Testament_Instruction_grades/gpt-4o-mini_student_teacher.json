  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that highlights the importance of the Psalms in the New Testament and their relevance for Christian believers today. However, the student missed the specific instruction given in the reference answer that Christians are instructed to sing psalms to God as a way of worshiping Him. By not addressing this key point directly, the student's response falls short in fully addressing the concern of applying biblical teachings to contemporary Christian worship."
