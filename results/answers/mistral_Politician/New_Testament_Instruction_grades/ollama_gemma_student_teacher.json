They correctly point out that while the New Testament doesn't explicitly instruct Christians to follow the Psalms as a literal rulebook, it encourages learning from and applying their teachings. \n\nThe student's examples from 1 Peter 2:25 and Matthew 22:37-40 effectively illustrate how the Psalms resonate with New Testament teachings about faith, love, and obedience. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on how contemporary Christian worship can apply the Psalms. Additionally, the connection to the concern about applying biblical teachings to contemporary worship could be made more explicitly."
