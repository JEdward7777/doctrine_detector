  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response does address the concern of identifying how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship, specifically highlighting the importance of understanding Old Testament wisdom and prophetic foreshadowing in light of New Testament teachings. The examples from 1 Peter 2:25 and Matthew 22:37-40 demonstrate a clear connection between the Psalms and contemporary Christian living.\n\nHowever, the response falls short of fully addressing the concern by not directly answering the question about what biblical teachings instruct Christians to do with the Psalms. While it's true that the New Testament does not provide specific instructions for following the Psalms as a rulebook, the response could have delved deeper into how the Psalms are used in contemporary Christian worship.\n\nThe comment on the grade would be: \"This response provides a good overview of the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, but could be improved by more explicitly addressing the question about what biblical teachings instruct Christians to do with the Psalms.\""
