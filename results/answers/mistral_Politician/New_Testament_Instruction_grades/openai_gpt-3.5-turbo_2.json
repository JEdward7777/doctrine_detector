It effectively connected key verses from the New Testament with the Psalms to demonstrate the relevance and significance of incorporating Psalms into worship practices. The response could be strengthened by providing more examples or practical applications of how Psalms can be integrated into modern worship settings. Overall, the response demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic and effectively addressed the concern."
