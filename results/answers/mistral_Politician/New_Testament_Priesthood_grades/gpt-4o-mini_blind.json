However, it falls short in terms of doctrinal correctness by not emphasizing the foundational truths of priesthood in the New Testament, such as the sacrificial role of Jesus as the ultimate High Priest, the priesthood of believers being derived from Him, and the significance of believers' access to God through Jesus Christ. The answer could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the doctrinal implications of priesthood in the Christian faith."
