  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 60. \n\nWhile the student did provide relevant biblical references and acknowledged the concept of the priesthood of all believers, their answer largely focused on the technical aspects and historical context of priesthood within Christianity. The answer could have been enhanced by emphasizing the personal and direct access to God in prayer that all believers have as priests, as well as the significance of interceding for oneself and others. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the concept of unity and inclusivity within the Christian community would have strengthened the explanation."
