They correctly identify the foundational passage in 1 Peter 2:5 and provide a clear explanation of how every believer is considered a spiritual leader. Additionally, the student thoughtfully addresses the distinction between the New Testament priesthood and the Old Testament priesthood and the fulfillment of sacrificial rites through Jesus Christ. Their approach is inclusive and respectful of different perspectives."
