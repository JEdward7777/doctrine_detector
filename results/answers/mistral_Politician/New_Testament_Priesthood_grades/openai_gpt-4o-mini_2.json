  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of the priesthood of all believers within a Christian worldview. The student effectively uses biblical references to support their explanation and acknowledges the distinction between the priesthood in the Old Testament and the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament. The response could be further strengthened by offering additional biblical examples or theological insights to deepen the discussion on this topic. Overall, a well-articulated and insightful response."
