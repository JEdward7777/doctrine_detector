The student correctly identifies the shift from external rituals to internal transformation through faith in Christ in the New Testament. However, the answer could have been strengthened by including more specific New Testament passages that illustrate the concept of purification and by delving deeper into the theological implications of this shift in understanding. Additionally, a more explicit connection to Christian doctrine and the role of Jesus as the ultimate purification sacrifice could have enhanced the answer."
