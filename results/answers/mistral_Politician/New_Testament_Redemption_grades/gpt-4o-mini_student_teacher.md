## [Answer](../New_Testament_Redemption.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the context of your question, it's essential to understand that the concept of "purification" in both the Old and New Testaments reflects religious and cultural practices of ancient societies. However, the understanding and application of this concept have evolved significantly between the two testaments.

In the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible), purification often refers to rituals and practices associated with atonement for sins, physical cleanliness, and spiritual purity. These rituals were typically performed by the priests and involved offerings, washings, and other ceremonial acts. For example, Leviticus 16 describes the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) when the High Priest would perform specific purification rites to cleanse the sanctuary and the Israelite people from their sins.

In contrast, the New Testament (Christian Bible) presents a different perspective on purification. Jesus and his teachings emphasize spiritual purity over physical rituals. In the New Testament, purification is often associated with moral regeneration and the inner transformation of individuals through faith in Christ. For example, Jesus said in Matthew 23:25-26, "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence." Here, Jesus criticizes the external ritualistic purifications while highlighting the need for inner transformation.

Ultimately, the concept of purification in the New Testament shifts from external rituals to internal transformation through faith in Christ, emphasizing love, humility, and compassion as essential qualities for spiritual purity. This change is a significant departure from the Old Testament's focus on physical cleansing and ritualistic practices.

The answer correctly identifies the shift from external rituals to internal transformation through faith in Christ in the New Testament.
