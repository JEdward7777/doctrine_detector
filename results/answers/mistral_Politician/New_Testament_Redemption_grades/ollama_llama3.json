However, it does not explicitly connect this concept to the concern about recognizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin.\n\nThe response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the concern and providing more explicit examples from Scripture that demonstrate the sufficient nature of Christ's sacrifice for eternal purification. Nonetheless, the overall response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concepts and is well-organized and coherent."
