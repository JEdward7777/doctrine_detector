  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer:\n\nGrade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a well-researched and comprehensive response that presents possible connections between John the Baptist and the Nazirite vow. They have referenced relevant biblical passages and offered thoughtful analysis, including multiple hints that suggest John the Baptist may have followed aspects of the Nazirite lifestyle. However, the student could have strengthened their argument by directly addressing the reference answer from the teacher, which explicitly connects John the Baptist to the Nazirite vow through the angel's announcement to Zechariah. Engaging with this specific evidence would have further enhanced the coherence and credibility of the student's interpretation."
