  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a well-supported analysis connecting Old Testament Nazirite practices with New Testament figures, specifically John the Baptist. The student effectively explains how certain aspects of John's life align with the Nazirite vow, offering scriptural evidence to support their claims. The only room for improvement would be to further explore how the Nazirite vow relates to the broader theme of biblical continuity between the Old and New Testaments. Overall, a strong response from a Christian worldview perspective."
