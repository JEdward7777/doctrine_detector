  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures to explore biblical continuity. The student effectively examines the Nazirite vow and presents evidence from the New Testament, such as John the Baptist's diet and lack of mention of cutting his hair, to suggest a connection to Nazirite practices. Additionally, the acknowledgment of varying scholarly opinions and the absence of definitive evidence in the New Testament show a nuanced understanding of the topic. Overall, this response provides a thoughtful analysis within a Christian worldview."
