## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 The purpose of Noah's Ark, as described in the Bible, serves as an instrument to preserve life during a catastrophic flood that was sent by God as a form of divine judgment upon humanity due to their wickedness. According to Genesis 6:19-20, "And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. Of the birds after their kinds, and of the animals after their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every kind will go in with you." This story symbolizes hope, salvation, and God's protection during difficult times. The Ark also represents unity among all life forms as different species were taken on board to preserve life on Earth.
