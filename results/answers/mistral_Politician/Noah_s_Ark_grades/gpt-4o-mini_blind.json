  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid overview of the purpose of Noah's Ark as described in the Bible. It correctly highlights the preservation of life during a catastrophic flood as a form of divine judgment due to humanity's wickedness, using relevant scripture references. The mention of hope, salvation, and God's protection is appropriate, as is the recognition of unity among different species being preserved on the Ark. However, to improve the grade, the student could deepen the analysis by discussing the theological significance of Noah's Ark in terms of God's mercy, faithfulness to his covenant, and the prefiguration of Christ as the ultimate Ark of salvation. Additionally, emphasizing the symbolism of the Ark as a type of the Church could enhance the overall theological understanding of the narrative."
