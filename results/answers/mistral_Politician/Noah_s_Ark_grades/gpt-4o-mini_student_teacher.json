However, the answer could be improved by further emphasizing the specific aspect of God's judgment on humanity as the reason for the flood, aligning it more closely with the reference answer's focus on protection from divine judgment. Strengthening the theological implications of God's plan for salvation and preservation within the narrative could enhance the overall theological coherence of the response."
