However, it could have gone further in exploring God's plan for salvation and preservation within the narrative. The provided answer is more focused on the practical aspect of the Ark's function rather than its deeper significance as a symbol of hope, salvation, and unity among all living things. Nevertheless, the response does touch on the idea of God's judgment, which is a crucial element in understanding His plan for salvation.\n\nTo improve, the response could have delved further into the biblical narrative to explore how the Ark represents God's promise of new life and redemption after the flood, highlighting its connection to the broader theme of salvation throughout Scripture."
