  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response acknowledges the concept of seeking guidance from a higher power like God in the pursuit of wisdom, which aligns with the concern provided. However, the answer falls short in fully embracing the Christian worldview aspect of explicitly linking wisdom to obedience to God's will. The student's emphasis on individual interpretation and the inclusion of wisdom from various sources diminishes the specific Christian perspective required for this question. Overall, while the answer partially addresses the concern, it lacks a clear connection between obedience to God and wisdom as outlined in the reference answer."
