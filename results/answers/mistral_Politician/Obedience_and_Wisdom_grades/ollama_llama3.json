  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe LLM response demonstrates a good understanding of the connection between listening to God and becoming wise, highlighting the role of spiritual guidance in personal growth and decision-making. It also acknowledges the importance of humility, empathy, and compassion in achieving wisdom.\n\nWhile the response does not explicitly state that obedience to God is necessary for gaining wisdom, it does recognize the value of seeking guidance from a higher power. The mention of various means by which individuals can find wisdom, such as education and personal growth, shows an openness to different perspectives and a desire to foster dialogue and mutual respect.\n\nThe only area where the response falls short is in its failure to explicitly link obedience to God with wisdom, as per the given answer. A more direct connection between the two would have strengthened the argument and demonstrated a deeper understanding of the concept.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written, thoughtful, and demonstrates a good grasp of the topic. However, it could be improved by making a clearer connection between obedience to God and wisdom."
