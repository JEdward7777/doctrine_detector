However, the response also leaves room for ambiguity by suggesting that wisdom is not exclusive to any particular belief system and can be attained through various means. From a Christian worldview, wisdom is deeply rooted in obedience to God and His teachings, and implying that wisdom can be obtained through other sources may dilute the significance of seeking God's guidance. It is important to emphasize the unique connection between obedience to God and wisdom in a Christian context."
