The response could have emphasized more explicitly that obedience to God's will, as revealed in the Bible, is the foundation of wisdom according to Christian beliefs. Additionally, the mention of wisdom being attainable through various means may dilute the central Christian perspective on where true wisdom originates from. Further integration of the Christian perspective on obedience to God as crucial in the pursuit of wisdom would have strengthened the response."
