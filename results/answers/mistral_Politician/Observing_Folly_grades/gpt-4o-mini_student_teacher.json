However, there was a lack of emphasis on the importance of recognizing folly in one's actions for encouraging better decision-making aligned with God\u2019s will as per the specified concern. The response also seemed to prioritize political correctness over the Biblical teachings on folly. More focus on guiding individuals towards aligning their actions with God\u2019s will could have strengthened the answer."
