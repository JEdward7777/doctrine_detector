However, it falls short in clearly connecting the described actions as against God's will and aligning them with the concern of encouraging better decision-making aligned with God's will. It could strengthen the response by explicitly stating the connection between recognizing folly in actions and the need for repentance and alignment with God's will for better decision-making."
