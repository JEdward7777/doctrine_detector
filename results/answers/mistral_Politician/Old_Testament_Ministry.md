## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the Old Testament, the priests carried out their ministries according to the Mosaic Law as outlined in books like Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The priests were divided into three groups: Aaronic priests, Levites, and High Priests.

1. Aaronic priests (descendants of Aaron) were responsible for daily rituals, ceremonies, and maintaining the sanctity of the Tabernacle or Temple. Their duties included offering sacrifices, burning incense, and inspecting the meal offerings. They also had to maintain purity and cleanliness by undergoing ritual baths and wearing specific garments.

2. Levites were descendants of Levi, one of Jacob's sons. While they were not Aaronic priests, they still played an essential role in the religious life of Israel. The main responsibilities of Levites included assisting the Aaronic priests during ceremonies, guarding the Tabernacle or Temple, teaching Torah (the Law), and singing in the choir.

3. High Priest was the most important of all priests, responsible for offering special sacrifices on behalf of the nation. The High Priest wore a unique set of priestly garments and held significant authority in religious matters. Only the High Priest could enter the Holy of Holies once a year on the Day of Atonement to make atonement for the people of Israel.

It is essential to note that the priesthood system in the Old Testament, as described in the Bible, was specific to the Jewish religious context during that time. Comparing it with modern-day clergy or religious figures might lead to misunderstandings and potential offense.
