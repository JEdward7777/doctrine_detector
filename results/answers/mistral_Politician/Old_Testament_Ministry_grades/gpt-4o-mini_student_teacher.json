  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of how priests carried out their ministry in the Old Testament, highlighting the roles of Aaronic priests, Levites, and the High Priest. The information presented is accurate and reflects a good understanding of the topic. However, the response could be improved by emphasizing more the spiritual significance and symbolism of the priestly activities in connecting the people with God through sacrifices and prayers, as noted in the reference answer. Additionally, a more explicit connection to how understanding these practices can inform current ministry approaches would enhance the response further."
