The information aligns well with the concern of recognizing the practices of the Old Testament to inform current ministry approaches, showcasing the importance of sacrificial service in both contexts. The only area that could be further strengthened is perhaps explicitly connecting the role of priests in the Old Testament with the concept of sacrificial service in current ministry practices."
