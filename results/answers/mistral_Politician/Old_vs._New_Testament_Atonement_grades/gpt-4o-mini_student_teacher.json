  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student effectively addresses the concern by outlining the historical and theological differences between the concept of atonement in the Old and New Testaments. They provide relevant information on the rituals and sacrifices in the Old Testament compared to the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ in the New Testament. However, the response lacks the explicit emphasis on the transition from temporary to permanent atonement as mentioned in the concern. Additionally, while maintaining an objective tone is commendable, a more focused and in-depth explanation rooted in a Christian worldview would have strengthened the response."
