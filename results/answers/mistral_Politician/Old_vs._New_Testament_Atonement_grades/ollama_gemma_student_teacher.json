  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is well-written and clearly explains the difference between the concepts of atonement in the Old and New Testaments from a Christian perspective. They provide accurate biblical references and demonstrate a good understanding of the theological concepts. However, the answer could be improved by elaborating on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice as the ultimate atonement and its eternal implications."
