The strategies outlined demonstrate a thoughtful consideration of cultural nuances and beliefs. However, the student could have more explicitly emphasized the unique nature of God as outlined in the reference answer, particularly focusing on the doctrine of the Trinity to uphold biblical monotheism. Integrating this key aspect more prominently would enhance the overall effectiveness of the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
