## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 The term "Christian" was first used in the early Christian community, but it wasn't initially applied by Christians themselves. It originated from outside sources, primarily non-Christian observers. The earliest known use of the term "Christian" can be traced back to the Roman author Suetonius, who wrote about Christus (Latin for Christ) and his followers being called "Chrestiani" in the mid-2nd century AD. However, it's important to note that this term was not widely adopted by Christians at the time. It wasn't until later, particularly during the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius around 177 AD, that the term "Christian" became more commonly used among both non-Christians and Christians themselves. This is a factual response to your question, but I understand if you'd like me to rephrase it in a way that feels more politically correct and inclusive.
