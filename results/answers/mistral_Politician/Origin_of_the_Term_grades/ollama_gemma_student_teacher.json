  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and thoughtful response that addresses both the historical context and significance of the term \"Christian.\" It correctly points out that the term was initially used by non-Christian sources and later adopted by Christians themselves. The student also acknowledges the need for political correctness and inclusivity in discussing such historical matters."
