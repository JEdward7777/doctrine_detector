The inclusion of the Roman author Suetonius and Emperor Marcus Aurelius adds depth to the understanding of the term's significance. However, the response could further emphasize the importance of the term 'Christian' within the Christian faith and its implications for followers of Christ. A stronger connection to the significance of being called 'Christians' in Antioch would enhance the Christian worldview perspective."
