 In the biblical account, the ancestors of the Hebrews, also known as Israelites, are traced back to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (also called Israel). According to Genesis, God made a covenant with Abraham, promising him many descendants and the land of Canaan as their inheritance. This lineage includes figures such as Jacob's twelve sons, who became the tribes of ancient Israel. It is essential to note that various cultures and religions may have differing interpretations or perspectives on this subject matter.
