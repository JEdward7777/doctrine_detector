  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the biblical account of the Hebrews' ancestry from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, highlighting the covenant God made with Abraham. It correctly mentions the twelve sons of Jacob who became the tribes of Israel. The student shows awareness of differing interpretations on this topic and suggests sensitivity in discussing religious or cultural heritage. Overall, a good answer that aligns with a Christian worldview, but could have incorporated more specific biblical references and theological depth for a higher grade."
