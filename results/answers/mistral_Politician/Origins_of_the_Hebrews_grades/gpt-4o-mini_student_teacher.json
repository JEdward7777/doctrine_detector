  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate answer, correctly mentioning Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as the ancestors of the Hebrews. They also highlighted the importance of understanding cultural and religious sensitivities when discussing such topics. The only minor improvement would be to explicitly state that the Hebrews are descended from Abraham through the line of Isaac and Jacob, as indicated in the reference answer."
