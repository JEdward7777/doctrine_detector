  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: \nThe response provides a decent overview of the significance of Passover for Christians in relation to Jesus, highlighting the Last Supper, Eucharist, and Jesus' arrest, trial, and crucifixion during Passover. The student could improve the grade by emphasizing the theological connection between Passover and Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb who takes away the sins of the world, as highlighted in the New Testament (1 Corinthians 5:7). Additionally, further exploration into how Jesus fulfills the symbolism of Passover could enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
