  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student has provided relevant information about the connection between the Old Testament Passover and Jesus in the New Testament, their answer lacks depth in explicitly highlighting the theological significance of Jesus as the Passover Lamb. The student correctly mentions the Last Supper and Jesus' crucifixion during the Passover time, but they could improve by elaborating on how Jesus fulfills the symbolism of the Passover Lamb in Christian belief.\n\nIt is positive that the student respects and acknowledges both Jewish and Christian traditions, showing sensitivity in their response. However, the answer could be enhanced by focusing more on the atonement aspect and the deeper theological implications of Jesus as the ultimate Passover sacrifice."
