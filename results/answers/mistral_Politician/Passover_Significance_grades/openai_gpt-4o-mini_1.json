  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the connection between the Old Testament Passover and the New Testament revelation of Jesus. The candidate effectively integrates Christian beliefs and teachings into the discussion, highlighting the significance of Jesus as the Passover Lamb. The response demonstrates an excellent understanding of how the Passover tradition relates to Christian faith, supported by relevant biblical references. The only improvement could be to explicitly mention the importance of recognizing and honoring both Jewish and Christian traditions in discussions of this nature."
