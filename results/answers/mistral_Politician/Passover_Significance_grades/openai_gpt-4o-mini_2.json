It effectively highlights how Jesus is portrayed as the Passover Lamb, symbolizing His atoning sacrifice for humanity. The discussion on the Last Supper, Eucharist, and events surrounding Jesus' crucifixion during Passover further reinforces the Christian perspective. However, there could have been more explicit references to scripture to strengthen the argument and deepen the biblical foundations of the answer."
