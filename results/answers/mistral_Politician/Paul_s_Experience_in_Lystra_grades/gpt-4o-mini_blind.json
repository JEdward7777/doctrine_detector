The focus on promoting understanding and cooperation among diverse religious communities, although noble, overlooks the central theme of persecution for the sake of the Gospel. A more in-depth exploration of how Paul's perseverance in the face of violent opposition relates to enduring faith and commitment to ministry would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
