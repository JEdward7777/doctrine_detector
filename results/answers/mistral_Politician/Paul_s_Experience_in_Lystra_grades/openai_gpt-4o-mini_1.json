The analysis effectively connects the biblical account to modern-day applications, highlighting key lessons for navigating challenges in today's pluralistic society. The response could be strengthened by incorporating more direct references to scriptural teachings or principles to underscore the Christian worldview perspective. Overall, a thoughtful and well-developed reflection."
