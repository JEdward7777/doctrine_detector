However, the response falls short in fully emphasizing the exclusivity of Jesus as the only way to God, which is a foundational Christian doctrine. It also veers off course in the closing paragraph by prioritizing inclusivity and tolerance over the doctrinal truth of Christian faith. More clarity and emphasis on the unique role of Jesus as the sole mediator between God and humanity would have strengthened the response."
