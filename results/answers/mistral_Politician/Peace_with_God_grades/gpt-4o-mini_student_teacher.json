  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the Christian perspective on achieving peace with God through faith in Jesus' sacrifice, citing relevant scripture verses. However, there is a concern with the student's neutrality and emphasis on inclusivity and tolerance rather than focusing on the significance of faith in the life of a Christian. The response could have been strengthened by emphasizing the transformative power of faith in Jesus' sacrifice in the life of a believer and how it shapes their relationship with God."
