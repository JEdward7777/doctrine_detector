It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. The only minor area for improvement would be to specifically mention the importance of repentance, as it is a crucial aspect of experiencing purification from sin in the Christian faith."
