  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical concept of \"woe is me\" as an expression of deep sorrow and recognition of sin. They correctly point out that the phrase suggests self-awareness and acknowledgement of suffering or shortcomings. Their explanation is clear and concise, acknowledging the need for further elaboration depending on the context. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to Christian theology or scripture to reinforce the spiritual dimension of the concern."
