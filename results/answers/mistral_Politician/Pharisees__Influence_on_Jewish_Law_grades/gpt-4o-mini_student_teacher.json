  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written and insightful answer that demonstrates an understanding of the impact of the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses on their relationship with Jesus and early Christians. They accurately describe the Pharisees' commitment to Jewish tradition and the contrast with Jesus' teachings. However, the answer could be improved by further emphasizing the significance of the Pharisees' focus on external observance rather than the underlying spiritual principles, as highlighted in the reference answer."
