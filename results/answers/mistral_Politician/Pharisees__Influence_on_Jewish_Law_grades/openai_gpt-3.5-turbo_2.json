It effectively addresses the concern by analyzing how the Pharisees' strict adherence to the letter of the law created obstacles for Jesus in conveying the deeper spiritual aspects of the teachings. The response could further strengthen its Christian perspective by emphasizing the role of sin, redemption, and the ultimate fulfillment of the Law through Jesus Christ."
