It highlights the Pharisees' strict interpretation of the Law of Moses as a point of tension with Jesus' emphasis on the spiritual aspects of the law. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the Pharisees' impact on Jesus' ministry and the conflicts that arose as a result, leading to the eventual emergence of Christianity as a separate religion."
