## [Answer](../Pharisees__Influence_on_Jewish_Law.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As individuals deeply rooted in Jewish tradition, the Pharisees were dedicated to following the Laws of Moses meticulously. They saw themselves as guardians of Jewish identity and upholders of religious purity. This devotion led them to interpret and apply these laws in a way that was often strict and prescriptive.

Jesus, on the other hand, was a Jewish teacher who often challenged traditional interpretations of the Law and offered a more spiritual, compassionate understanding of God's teachings. His messages frequently emphasized love, forgiveness, and humilityâ€”values that sometimes contradicted the Pharisees' emphasis on ritual purity and external observance.

Because of Jesus' teachings, which appeared to many Pharisees as a threat to traditional Jewish values, there was tension between Jesus and some of them. This tension eventually led to conflicts, as Jesus and his followers were perceived by some Pharisees as breaking the Law or encouraging others to do so. After Jesus' crucifixion, early Christians continued to follow Jesus' teachings, which further distanced them from the Pharisees and other Jewish religious authorities who saw Christianity as a threat to Judaism.

In summary, the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses created a gap between them and Jesus and early Christians due to their differing interpretations and applications of these laws and religious values. This divide eventually contributed to conflict and ultimately the emergence of Christianity as a distinct religion separate from Judaism.
