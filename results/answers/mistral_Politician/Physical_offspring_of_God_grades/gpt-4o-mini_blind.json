However, from a Christian perspective, it missed the opportunity to specifically address the doctrinal understanding of Jesus as the Son of God in Christianity. It could have included key points such as the Incarnation, the unique relationship between Jesus and God the Father, and the concept of Jesus as the Second Person of the Trinity. Integrating these theological elements would have enhanced the clarity and doctrinal correctness of the response."
