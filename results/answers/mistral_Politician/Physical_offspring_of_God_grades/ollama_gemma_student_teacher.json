  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a thoughtful and respectful response that addresses the concern for clarity and accuracy regarding the term \"Son of God.\" \n\nThe student correctly points out that the term is used metaphorically in various religious traditions and highlights the importance of open dialogue and respect for diverse beliefs. Additionally, the student's emphasis on fostering an inclusive society where everyone feels heard and understood is commendable. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from a more explicit statement that aligns with the Christian worldview by clarifying that the \"Son of God\" in Christianity refers to Jesus Christ and his divine nature and relationship with God the Father."
