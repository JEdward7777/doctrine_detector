  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response generally aligns with the correct teaching that the term \"Son of God\" refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation. The author's emphasis on clarifying the term through interfaith dialogue and promoting mutual respect for diverse beliefs is also commendable.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response could be more explicit in teaching that Jesus is the unique Son of God, as revealed in Scripture. While the response mentions \"divine status\" and \"special relationship,\" it does not specifically affirm Jesus' uniqueness or the implications of this title for Christian theology.\n\nThe concern about proper teaching preventing doctrinal errors and retaining biblical terminology is also partially addressed. The author's approach to clarifying the term and promoting interfaith dialogue may help prevent misunderstandings, but a more explicit emphasis on biblical teaching could strengthen the response further.\n\nOverall, while the response has some areas of strength, it could benefit from greater clarity on the unique significance of Jesus as the Son of God in Christian theology."
