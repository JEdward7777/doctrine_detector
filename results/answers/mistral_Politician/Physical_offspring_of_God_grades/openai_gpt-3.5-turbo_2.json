However, it falls slightly short in directly addressing the concern of preventing doctrinal errors and retaining biblical terminology. While the response encourages open dialogue and understanding among different faiths, it could have placed a stronger emphasis on the importance of aligning teachings with biblical truths to avoid doctrinal errors."
