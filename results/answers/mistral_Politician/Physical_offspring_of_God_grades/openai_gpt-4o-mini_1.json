In a Christian worldview, it is important to accurately teach and uphold biblical terminology to prevent doctrinal errors. Encouraging dialogue with spiritual leaders and scholars is valuable, but ensuring a clear articulation of Christian beliefs is essential when addressing theological concepts."
