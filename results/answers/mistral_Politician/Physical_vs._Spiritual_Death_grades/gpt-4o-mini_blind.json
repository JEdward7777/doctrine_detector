  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer does not address the question from a Christian-specific worldview. It lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to differentiate between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish' according to Christian beliefs. The response focuses more on cultural sensitivity and inclusivity rather than providing a Biblical perspective on the distinction between physical death and spiritual \"perishing.\" A stronger emphasis on Christian doctrine and teachings would significantly improve the grade."
