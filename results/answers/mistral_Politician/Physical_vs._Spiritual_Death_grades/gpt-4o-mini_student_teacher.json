  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear explanation of the distinction between physical death and the spiritual concept of 'perish' as requested in the question. Instead, the response focuses more on language sensitivity and inclusivity without directly addressing the core issue at hand from a Christian worldview perspective. The emphasis should have been on the eternal consequences and separation from God that 'perish' signifies in a spiritual context, as highlighted in the reference answer."
