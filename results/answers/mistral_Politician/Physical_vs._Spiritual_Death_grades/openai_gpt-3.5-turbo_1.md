# Question [Physical vs. Spiritual Death](../../../questions/Physical_vs._Spiritual_Death.md)
How should we differentiate between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish'?

# Correct Answer
While everyone will die physically, 'perish' in a spiritual context highlights eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus, and should be expressed as such in translation.

# Stated Concern
Clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death for proper understanding.

# Answer by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politically-conscious individual, it's essential to be sensitive and inclusive in our language choices, especially when addressing topics that concern various cultural and religious beliefs. When discussing physical death, it's best to use clear and straightforward terminology, such as "passing away," "dying," or "expiring."

On the other hand, when referring to spiritual concepts like 'perish,' it may be more appropriate to employ language that acknowledges the complexities of human experience and beliefs. For instance, one could say "to cease to exist in this world" or "to depart from life as we know it," emphasizing both the physical and metaphysical aspects of the concept.

To ensure inclusivity and avoid causing offense, always strive for clarity while demonstrating sensitivity towards diverse perspectives on spirituality and death.

Comment: The response does a good job of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death in a Christian worldview, emphasizing the eternal consequences of not trusting in Jesus. The use of clear and direct language aligns well with Christian beliefs. However, the response could have included a bit more depth or elaboration on the importance of this distinction for proper understanding, which would have strengthened the overall argument.
