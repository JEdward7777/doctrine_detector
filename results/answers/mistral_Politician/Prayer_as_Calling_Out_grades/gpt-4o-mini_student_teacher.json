  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 40. While the student attempted to address the concern of inclusivity in prayer, their interpretation lacks the core Christian perspective of dependence on God. In a Christian worldview, \"calling out to the Lord\" implies recognizing God as the ultimate source of help and relying on Him for guidance and support in daily life. The student's emphasis on a symbolic interpretation for inclusivity overlooks the foundational Christian understanding of prayer as a direct communication with God. Encouraging multicultural sensitivity in communication is important, but it should not dilute the significance of the biblical concept being discussed."
