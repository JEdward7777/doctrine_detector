While it provides some suggestions for rephrasing the phrase to make it more inclusive, it doesn't explicitly connect this inclusivity to the importance of prayer and dependence on God.\n\nThe response also assumes that the reader is already familiar with Christian traditions and the concept of seeking help from God through prayer, which may not be the case. To fully address the concern, the response could have explored how prayer and dependence on God can bring people together across religious lines and provide a foundation for unity and understanding.\n\nOverall, while the response shows some creativity in rephrasing the phrase to make it more inclusive, it doesn't fully engage with the concern of the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life."
