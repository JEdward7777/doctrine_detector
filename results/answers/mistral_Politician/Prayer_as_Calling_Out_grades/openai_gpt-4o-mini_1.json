Instead, it attempts to reinterpret a Christian phrase in a way that dilutes its original meaning and significance. From a Christian worldview, it is essential to understand and uphold the true meaning of prayer and calling out to the Lord as an expression of trust and dependence on God. The response falls short in this aspect."
