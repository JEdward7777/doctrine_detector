 In a Christian context, the term "predestination" generally refers to the doctrine that God predetermines or predestines certain events, including human salvation or damnation, before the creation of the world. This concept is often associated with Calvinism and can be found in various forms across different Christian denominations. However, it's important to note that there may be slight variations in interpretation among different Christian groups. It's always a good idea to clarify specific beliefs within the context of the individual or group in question, as not all Christians hold the same views on predestination.
