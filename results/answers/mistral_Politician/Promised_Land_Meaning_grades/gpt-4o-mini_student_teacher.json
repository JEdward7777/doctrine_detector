  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the Promised Land in the biblical narrative, acknowledging its importance to the Israelites and its broader cultural and religious implications. However, the student's answer lacks specificity in identifying the land as Canaan, as highlighted in the reference answer. To improve the grade, the student should have focused more on the direct biblical reference and context regarding Canaan as the Promised Land."
