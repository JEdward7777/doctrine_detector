 In the context of the biblical narrative, the term "Promised Land" refers to the land that God promised to give to Abraham and his descendants, the Israelites. This land, primarily encompassing modern-day Israel and Palestine, was envisioned as a fertile and abundant territory, a place of peace, prosperity, and security for the Israelite people, according to the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament.
