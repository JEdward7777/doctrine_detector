  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a general overview of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in Biblical prophecies, but it falls short in presenting a Christian-specific worldview. The answer lacks depth in explaining the significance of the term within the context of God's covenant relationship with Israel and the redemption plan through Jesus Christ. Additionally, it does not emphasize the role of Jerusalem as a central focus in God's prophetic plan. While the student displays sensitivity, respect, and inclusivity, the answer would benefit from a stronger doctrinal foundation and clearer connection to Christian beliefs."
