  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides a general overview of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in Biblical prophecies and acknowledges its metaphorical representation of Jerusalem or the people of Israel, there are areas where improvement is needed. \n\nThe student did not explicitly connect the term \"Daughter of Zion\" to the people of Israel and their relationship with God, as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, the student focused more on the political correctness, inclusivity, and cultural sensitivity aspects rather than delving deeper into the prophetic nature and historical context of the term to apply the scriptures effectively today.\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the general concept but lacks depth in addressing the specific concern of recognizing the prophetic nature of terms to better apply the scriptures today from a Christian worldview perspective."
