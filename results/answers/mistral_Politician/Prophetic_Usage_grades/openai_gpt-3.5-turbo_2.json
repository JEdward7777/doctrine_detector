The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing the importance of recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and understanding their historical context to apply the scriptures today. The only potential improvement could be to highlight the implications of these prophecies for Christians today and how they relate to the broader theme of God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ."
