  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: While this response acknowledges the importance of the Bible in discussing calling or purpose, it does not prioritize a Christian specific worldview in providing guidance. The answer lacks a clear foundation in biblical teachings and fails to emphasize the importance of aligning one's purpose with God's will as revealed in Scripture. The focus on inclusivity and sensitivity, while important in certain contexts, takes center stage over the essential doctrinal correctness necessary in addressing a question from a Christian perspective. The approach presented here falls short in providing a solid biblical framework for discerning calling or purpose according to Christian beliefs."
