  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-structured and inclusive, deviates significantly from the Christian specific worldview presented in the reference answer. The emphasis on cultural sensitivity and inclusivity, while important in various contexts, dilutes the Christian perspective on discerning one's calling. The student's response lacks a clear focus on the role of prayer, Scripture, and the Holy Spirit in discerning God's purpose. Encouraging service and seeking counsel are valuable suggestions, but without anchoring them in Biblical principles, the answer falls short of providing a distinctly Christian approach to finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life."
