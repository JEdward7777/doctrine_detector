  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life from a Christian worldview. It effectively expands on the initial answer by incorporating practical steps rooted in prayer, meditation, study of Scripture, service to others, seeking counsel, and being open to change. The emphasis on the importance of understanding personal gifts and passions aligns well with Christian teachings on discerning one's calling. The response encourages an individual to seek guidance not only from the Holy Spirit but also from trusted sources such as religious leaders and mentors. The only area for improvement would be to highlight the primacy of seeking God's will and aligning one's purpose with His plans throughout the response."
