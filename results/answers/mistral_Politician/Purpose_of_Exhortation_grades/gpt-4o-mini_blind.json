  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The response provides a solid overview of the purpose of exhortation in the New Testament, emphasizing its role in guiding and encouraging believers to live according to God's will. However, it could have been strengthened by directly referencing specific biblical passages that speak to the purpose of exhortation. Additionally, while the emphasis on love, unity, and humility is commendable, a stronger focus on the centrality of Christ in exhortation would have enhanced the theological depth of the answer. Overall, the response demonstrates a foundational understanding but could benefit from more explicit scriptural support and a clearer emphasis on Christ as the ultimate focus of exhortation in the Christian faith."
