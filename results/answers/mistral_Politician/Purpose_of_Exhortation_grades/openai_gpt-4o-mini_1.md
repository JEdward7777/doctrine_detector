## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a helpful and respectful assistant, I would like to clarify that I am an AI model, not a politician or a theologian. However, I can share with you what scholars have traditionally understood about the purpose of exhortation in the New Testament based on biblical research and theological studies.

In the New Testament, exhortation is often used to encourage believers to live according to God's will, obey His commands, and grow in their faith. It is a call for action, an appeal to follow Jesus Christ and imitate Him in one's daily life. Exhortations also serve to remind believers of the teachings of Jesus and the apostles, emphasizing the importance of love, unity, humility, and other Christian virtues.

Therefore, the primary purpose of exhortation according to the New Testament is to guide, encourage, and inspire followers of Christ to live a life that reflects their faith in Jesus, growing in their relationship with Him and demonstrating His love to others. It aims to bring believers closer to God and help them become more like Jesus.

It's important to note that the New Testament exhortations are not intended to offend but rather to guide people towards a deeper understanding of God's will for their lives. By seeking to understand these exhortations, we can grow in our faith and live a life that brings glory to God.
