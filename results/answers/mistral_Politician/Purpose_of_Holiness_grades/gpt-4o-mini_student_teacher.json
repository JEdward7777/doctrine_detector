  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response addressing the practical application of holiness in a believer's life from a Christian perspective. However, the answer lacked a direct focus on the specific expectations outlined in the reference answer given by the teacher. The response touched on various aspects of living a holy life but did not center on the core elements of following God's commandments, bringing glory to Him through practices, and being transformed by the Holy Spirit. In terms of a Christian worldview, the student's answer, while insightful, could have been more aligned with the reference provided."
