It effectively addresses the concern regarding the practical application of holiness in a believer's life by referencing specific biblical teachings and examples. The response also maintains a respectful and inclusive tone, which is essential when discussing matters of faith. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in shaping a believer's lifestyle to reflect holiness. Overall, a solid understanding of practical holiness from a Christian worldview is demonstrated."
