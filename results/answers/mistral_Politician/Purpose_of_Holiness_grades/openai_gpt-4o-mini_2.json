  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation of how Christians are called to live holy lives through adherence to biblical principles, reflecting Christ's character, engaging in spiritual disciplines, and serving others. The answer effectively addressed the practical application of holiness in a believer's life within a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie the concept of being transformed by the Holy Spirit to the practical application of holiness as the answer implies this transformation but does not explicitly state it."
