However, it fails to recognize the deeper theological significance of parables as a means of both revealing truth to those with receptive hearts and concealing truth from those who are spiritually blind or hardened in unbelief. Additionally, the mention of Jesus behaving like a politician may not align well with a Christian worldview, as Jesus' teachings were not about popularity or avoiding offense but about proclaiming the truth regardless of the consequences. There is room for improvement in delving into the specific biblical reasons and implications behind Jesus' use of parables."
