  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that shows insight into the purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings. However, the student's answer does not align closely with the Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, the primary purpose of Jesus using parables was to reveal truth to his disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe, rather than as a political tool to communicate complex spiritual truths in a relatable manner. Receiving a lower grade is necessary to reflect the misalignment with the Christian perspective provided by the teacher."
