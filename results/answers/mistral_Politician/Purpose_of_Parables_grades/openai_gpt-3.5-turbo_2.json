It effectively explores how these teaching methods facilitated understanding for believers while presenting a barrier for those who were not open to receiving the truths. The integration of faith implications is well articulated within a Christian worldview. However, the response could have tied the primary purpose of Jesus using parables more directly to the core aspect of hiding truth from unbelievers, as stated in the given answer. Overall, a solid evaluation with room for slightly deeper integration of the core concern provided."
