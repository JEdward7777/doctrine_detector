  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer detailing various key purposes of prayer as outlined in the Bible. However, the student's response could have more explicitly emphasized the importance of seeking wisdom, confessing sins, and interceding for others as stated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. A stronger alignment with the specific purposes highlighted in the Bible would have enhanced the overall Christian worldview perspective in the response."
