  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the role of Psalms in the worship practices of the nation of Israel, highlighting various aspects such as praise, prayers, historical records, and educational tools. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the specific emotions and expressions conveyed through the Psalms, as mentioned in the reference answer. The student did well in explaining the general significance of the Psalms but missed focusing on the specific emotional and spiritual elements central to the worship practices of Israel."
