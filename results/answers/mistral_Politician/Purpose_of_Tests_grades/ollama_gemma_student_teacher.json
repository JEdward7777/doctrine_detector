  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of tests in a Christian worldview. It acknowledges the diverse perspectives and experiences within the Christian community and avoids making generalizations or assumptions. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to the teacher's reference answer, which emphasizes the exposure of sin as a purpose of tests."
