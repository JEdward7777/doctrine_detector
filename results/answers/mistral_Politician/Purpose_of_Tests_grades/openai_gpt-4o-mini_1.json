However, the response falls short in explicitly referencing the perspective that tests are allowed by God to expose sin, encourage repentance, and foster a deeper relationship with Him. It does provide a general overview of common interpretations across belief systems, but a stronger integration of the specific Christian perspective would have improved the response."
