  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments:\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive overview of various religious traditions' perspectives on the soul and its relationship with God, the response lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. It does not specifically address the scriptural aspects of the soul's relationship with God as described in the Bible. The emphasis on inclusivity and diversity overshadows the need to present a Christian perspective based on Christian scriptures. The response is informative but does not align adequately with a Christian-specific worldview on the soul's relationship with God as described in scripture."
