However, the student missed the opportunity to connect the significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. They could have further explored how Jesus, being referred to as 'Rabbi' in the New Testament, signifies his role as a teacher of God's laws and the continuity of rabbinic teaching in Christianity. Encouraging more depth and connection to Christian teachings would improve the response."
