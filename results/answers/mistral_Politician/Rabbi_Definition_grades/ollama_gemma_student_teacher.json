It accurately explains that the term refers to a teacher of Jewish law and tradition, and correctly notes its usage in the New Testament. However, it could benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian perspective on the role of rabbis in the New Testament, specifically addressing how their teachings influenced early Christianity."
