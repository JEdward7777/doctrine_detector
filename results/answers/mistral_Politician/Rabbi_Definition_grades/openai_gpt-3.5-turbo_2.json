  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the term 'Rabbi' in its literal meaning and its significance as a Jewish religious teacher. The response also acknowledges the usage of 'Rabbi' in the New Testament without conferring a formal title in Christianity. The acknowledgment of cultural and religious differences when using such terms shows respect for diverse beliefs. However, the response could have elaborated more on the specific role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament to further deepen the Christian perspective."
