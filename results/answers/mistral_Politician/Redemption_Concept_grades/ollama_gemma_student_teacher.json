  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of redemption in both biblical and practical contexts. They clearly explain the act of redemption in both personal and property contexts, providing relevant examples from the Old Testament. The student also acknowledges the importance of community support, compassion, and restorative justice. While their answer aligns well with the reference answer, it lacks a deeper analysis of the theological significance of Jesus as the ultimate redeemer."
