However, it would have been beneficial to emphasize the connection between Jesus' institution of the Lord's Supper and Paul's teachings on it, as well as delve deeper into the theological implications of the practice within Christian doctrine. Additionally, the mention of political correctness seems out of place in this theological discussion."
