  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-informed and detailed answer on the significance of the Lord's Supper, referencing key Biblical passages and the purpose of the practice. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the spiritual and communal aspects of the Lord's Supper. However, the student could have directly addressed the specific question of why the apostle Paul established the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers, which was the main focus of the inquiry. The student's discussion on political correctness, although relevant in some contexts, was not directly related to the question at hand."
