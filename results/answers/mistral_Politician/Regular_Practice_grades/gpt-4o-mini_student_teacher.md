## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the context of the New Testament, the Lord's Supper (or Eucharist) was instituted by Jesus Christ Himself during the Last Supper with His disciples, not by Apostle Paul. However, Paul did write extensively about its significance and practice among early Christian communities.

The primary reason for establishing the Lord's Supper, as recorded in 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, was to remember Jesus' sacrifice. It serves as a way for believers to commemorate His death and resurrection, reaffirm their faith in Him, and strengthen their spiritual unity as a community of followers.

The Lord's Supper is also intended to foster self-examination and humility among participants, reminding them of the sacrifice Jesus made on the cross for their sins, and encouraging them to live lives worthy of that sacrifice. It provides an opportunity for believers to reflect upon their relationship with Christ and one another.

In terms of being politically correct, it's important to note that religious beliefs are deeply personal, and what may be seen as politically correct can vary greatly among individuals and communities. In this context, the institution of the Lord's Supper is a symbolic practice shared by millions of Christians worldwide, and its significance lies in the common belief in Jesus Christ and His teachings.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a well-informed and detailed answer on the significance of the Lord's Supper, referencing key Biblical passages and the purpose of the practice. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the spiritual and communal aspects of the Lord's Supper. However, the student could have directly addressed the specific question of why the apostle Paul established the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers, which was the main focus of the inquiry. The student's discussion on political correctness, although relevant in some contexts, was not directly related to the question at hand.
