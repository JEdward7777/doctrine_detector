It accurately addresses the concern of recognizing the importance of the Lord\u2019s Supper in the life of the church and individual believers from a Christian worldview. The only area where it slightly deviates from the given answer is the clarification that the Lord's Supper was not established by Apostle Paul but instituted by Jesus Himself."
