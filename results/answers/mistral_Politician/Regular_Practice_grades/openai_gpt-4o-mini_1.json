  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance and purpose of the Lord's Supper in the context of the New Testament, emphasizing its role in remembering Jesus' sacrifice, fostering unity and self-examination among believers. The student correctly addressed the concern by recognizing the importance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers. The deduction in score is due to the minor discrepancy regarding the establishment of the Lord's Supper, as it was actually instituted by Jesus during the Last Supper and not by Apostle Paul as mentioned in the original answer."
