The explanation of the Lord's Supper as a practice to remember Jesus' sacrifice, affirm faith, foster self-examination, and promote unity among believers demonstrates a deep understanding of its importance in the life of the church and individual believers. The only slight deduction is for not directly addressing the given concern in the initial response, but the content overall is excellent."
