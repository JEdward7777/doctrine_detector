However, the answer lacks specificity in terms of the Christian understanding of these terms. From a Christian worldview, 'atonement' specifically refers to the work of Jesus Christ on the cross to reconcile humanity with God through the forgiveness of sins, whereas 'propitiation' emphasizes the appeasement of God's wrath through the sacrifice of Jesus as the satisfactory payment for sin. The explanation would benefit from a clearer articulation of these foundational Christian doctrines."
