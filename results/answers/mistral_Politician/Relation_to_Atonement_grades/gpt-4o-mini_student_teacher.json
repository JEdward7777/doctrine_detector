  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-detailed explanation of both 'atonement' and 'propitiation' and successfully highlighted their similarities and differences. However, the student's approach, mentioning their perspective as a politician, may not align with a Christian-specific worldview. It would have been more effective to approach the explanation from a theological standpoint. Additionally, the student did not specifically address the crucial point emphasized in the reference answer about propitiation involving appeasing God's wrath, which is an important aspect from a Christian perspective."
