  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response an 80.\n\nThe response does attempt to clarify the differences and similarities between \"propitiation\" and \"atonement\", which aligns with the concern provided. The writer provides some definition and context for both terms, which is helpful in understanding their nuances. They also make a valid point about propitiation emphasizing appeasing God's wrath specifically.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples or illustrations to drive home the differences between the two terms. Additionally, while the writer touches on the idea that atonement is about making amends and restoring harmony, they do not delve as deeply into this concept as they do with propitiation. A more balanced approach to discussing both terms would strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding these theological terms, but could benefit from further development and illustration."
