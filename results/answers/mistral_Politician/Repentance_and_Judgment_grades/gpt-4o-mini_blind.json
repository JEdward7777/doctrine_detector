  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the answer provides a general overview of the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God as understood in many religious communities, it lacks doctrinal specificity and clarity. The response could benefit from citing more specific Bible verses that directly address the connection between repentance and God's wrath. Additionally, the language used in the answer leans more towards a neutral and inclusive tone rather than a distinctly Christian perspective. Moving forward, the student should aim to focus on presenting a more precise and doctrinally sound explanation rooted in biblical teachings."
