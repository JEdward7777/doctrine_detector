  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God in both the Old and New Testaments. They correctly highlight the importance of repentance in seeking God's forgiveness and avoiding His judgment. However, the answer lacks a strong emphasis on the consequences of not repenting and the seriousness of God's wrath for unrepentant sinners, which is a significant aspect of the Christian worldview. Encouraging a deeper reflection on the eternal consequences of sin without repentance would strengthen the student's response from a Christian perspective."
