  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God from a Christian perspective. They effectively cite relevant biblical passages and explain the concept of repentance in both the Old and New Testaments. However, the answer could benefit from a clearer articulation of the connection between repentance and avoiding God's judgment, as suggested in the reference answer."
