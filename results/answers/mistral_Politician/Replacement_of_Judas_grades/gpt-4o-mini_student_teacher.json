  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the biblical account regarding the replacement of Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. The response acknowledges the selection of Matthias by the remaining apostles without adding any incorrect information. The inclusion of Acts 1:21-26 further strengthens the accuracy of the answer. The student also appropriately addresses the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. Overall, this is a well-informed and thoughtful response from a Christian worldview."
