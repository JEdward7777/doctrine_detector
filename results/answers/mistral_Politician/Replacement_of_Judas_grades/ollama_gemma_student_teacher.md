Recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.

## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 To provide an accurate answer, it's important to clarify that according to Christian belief, Jesus did not appoint a direct replacement for Judas Iscariot among the original twelve apostles. Instead, Matthias was chosen by the remaining apostles as a separate member of their group following Judas' betrayal and suicide (Acts 1:21-26). This event is considered distinct from Jesus' appointment of the original twelve apostles.

This response aims to provide a politically correct explanation that respects various religious perspectives without promoting any particular denomination or interpretation as definitive.
