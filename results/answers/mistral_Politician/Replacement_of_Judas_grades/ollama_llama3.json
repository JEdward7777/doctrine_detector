However, the response does not explicitly address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. While it mentions the appointment of Matthias as a separate event from Jesus' original appointment of the twelve apostles, it could be improved by more directly highlighting the significance of this event in maintaining the apostolic leadership and legacy."
