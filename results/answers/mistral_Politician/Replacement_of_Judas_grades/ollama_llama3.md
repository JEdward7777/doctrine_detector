## Question [Replacement of Judas](../../../questions/Replacement_of_Judas.md)
Who was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles?

## Correct Answer
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after Judas' betrayal and subsequent death.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.

## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 To provide an accurate answer, it's important to clarify that according to Christian belief, Jesus did not appoint a direct replacement for Judas Iscariot among the original twelve apostles. Instead, Matthias was chosen by the remaining apostles as a separate member of their group following Judas' betrayal and suicide (Acts 1:21-26). This event is considered distinct from Jesus' appointment of the original twelve apostles.

This response aims to provide a politically correct explanation that respects various religious perspectives without promoting any particular denomination or interpretation as definitive.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately states that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, which is in line with the given answer. However, the response does not explicitly address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. While it mentions the appointment of Matthias as a separate event from Jesus' original appointment of the twelve apostles, it could be improved by more directly highlighting the significance of this event in maintaining the apostolic leadership and legacy.
