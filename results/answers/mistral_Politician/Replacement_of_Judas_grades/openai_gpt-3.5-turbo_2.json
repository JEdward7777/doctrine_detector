  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response accurately reflects the Christian belief that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death, in line with Acts 1:21-26. The explanation provided in the response maintains the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, which is an important aspect of Christian theology. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the significance of Matthias being chosen by the remaining apostles as guided by the Holy Spirit, highlighting the belief in divine intervention in leadership succession."
