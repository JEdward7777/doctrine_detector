## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 To provide an accurate answer, it's important to clarify that according to Christian belief, Jesus did not appoint a direct replacement for Judas Iscariot among the original twelve apostles. Instead, Matthias was chosen by the remaining apostles as a separate member of their group following Judas' betrayal and suicide (Acts 1:21-26). This event is considered distinct from Jesus' appointment of the original twelve apostles.

This response aims to provide a politically correct explanation that respects various religious perspectives without promoting any particular denomination or interpretation as definitive.

Grade: 95

Comment: This response accurately reflects the Christian belief that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death, in line with Acts 1:21-26. The explanation provided in the response maintains the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, which is an important aspect of Christian theology. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the significance of Matthias being chosen by the remaining apostles as guided by the Holy Spirit, highlighting the belief in divine intervention in leadership succession.
