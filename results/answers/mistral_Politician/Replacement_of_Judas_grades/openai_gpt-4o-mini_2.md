Recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.

## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 To provide an accurate answer, it's important to clarify that according to Christian belief, Jesus did not appoint a direct replacement for Judas Iscariot among the original twelve apostles. Instead, Matthias was chosen by the remaining apostles as a separate member of their group following Judas' betrayal and suicide (Acts 1:21-26). This event is considered distinct from Jesus' appointment of the original twelve apostles.

This response aims to provide a politically correct explanation that respects various religious perspectives without promoting any particular denomination or interpretation as definitive.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response is accurate in stating that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, maintaining the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The use of the passage from Acts adds context and support to the answer. However, the response could have emphasized more explicitly the significance of maintaining the continuity of apostolic leadership within the Christian worldview, which would have further strengthened the Christian perspective.
