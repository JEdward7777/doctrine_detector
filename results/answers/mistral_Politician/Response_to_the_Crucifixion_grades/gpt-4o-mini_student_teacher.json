  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's response touches on the event of the crucifixion and acknowledges the crowd's role, it lacks the essential elements of repentance and faith emphasized in Peter's addressing of the crowd. The answer focuses more on unity, growth, and reflection rather than the core Christian message of repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. The student should strengthen the connection between historical events and the call to respond to the gospel to align with a Christian worldview."
