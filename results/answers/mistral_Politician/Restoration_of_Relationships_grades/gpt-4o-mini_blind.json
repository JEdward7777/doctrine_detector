It fails to acknowledge the foundational Christian belief in the need for redemption through faith in Jesus Christ. Additionally, it promotes a relativistic view of truth rather than presenting the Christian perspective on restoration and forgiveness. It lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to reflect a Christian understanding of redemption."
