However, there is a lack of emphasis on the significance of reconciliation in the Christian faith, such as highlighting the importance of Jesus Christ's sacrifice for reconciliation or the transformational power it holds for believers. The response could be strengthened by delving deeper into the theological implications of reconciliation within a Christian worldview."
