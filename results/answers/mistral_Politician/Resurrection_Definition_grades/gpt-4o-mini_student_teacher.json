  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed explanation of the Christian concept of resurrection, emphasizing Jesus Christ's resurrection and its significance in Christian theology. They correctly mention the hope for the bodily resurrection of believers. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the act of becoming alive again after death, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
