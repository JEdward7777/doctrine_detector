  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern of understanding the fundamental concept of resurrection, but could be more comprehensive in its explanation. It correctly identifies Jesus' resurrection as an example of God's power to bring someone back to life, and mentions the significance of this event in Christian belief. However, it does not delve deeply into the biblical context or the broader implications of resurrection for Christian beliefs about life after death. To achieve a higher grade, the response could provide more detail on the scriptural basis for resurrection and its relevance to Christian teachings on salvation, eternal life, and the afterlife.\n\nThe similarity score is 80%, as the response accurately conveys the idea that Jesus' resurrection is an example of God's power, but does not fully capture the scope of the concept in Christian theology."
