However, it lacks depth and fails to strongly emphasize the foundational Christian doctrine of propitiation through Christ's atonement on the cross. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the biblical foundation of God's wrath and how it aligns with His attributes of love and mercy, providing a more robust theological explanation."
