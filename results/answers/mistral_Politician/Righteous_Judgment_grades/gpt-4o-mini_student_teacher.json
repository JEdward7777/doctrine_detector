  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thoughtful perspective on reconciling God's wrath with His nature as loving and merciful, emphasizing the corrective and salvific aspects of God's wrath. However, the answer lacks a clear assertion of God's wrath as a reflection of His justice and holiness, which are essential components of understanding God's attributes without contradiction in Biblical teaching. Additionally, while the answer touches on the role of Jesus Christ's sacrifice in providing redemption, it could have more directly linked God's love and mercy to His offer of salvation and forgiveness through repentance and belief in Him, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the student shows good understanding but could strengthen the theological foundation of their argument."
