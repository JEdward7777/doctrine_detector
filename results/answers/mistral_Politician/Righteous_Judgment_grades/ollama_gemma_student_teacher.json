It provides a well-reasoned and coherent explanation of how these attributes coexist without contradiction in Biblical teaching. The student correctly emphasizes that God's wrath is not seen as an expression of anger or vengeance, but rather as a manifestation of love and justice. Additionally, the student's acknowledgement of the infinite nature of God's love and mercy, as well as the role of Jesus Christ's sacrifice, aligns with traditional Christian beliefs."
