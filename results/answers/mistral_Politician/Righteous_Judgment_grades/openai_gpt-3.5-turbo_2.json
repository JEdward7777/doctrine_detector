The explanation is well-reasoned and aligns closely with the Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of God's justice, holiness, and offer of salvation through repentance and faith. However, there could have been a more explicit emphasis on the harmonious coexistence of these attributes in God's nature as portrayed in the Bible."
