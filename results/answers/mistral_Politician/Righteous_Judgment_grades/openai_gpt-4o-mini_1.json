It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing God's justice, holiness, and righteousness, while also highlighting His love, mercy, and offer of salvation through repentance and belief in Him. The inclusion of Jesus Christ's sacrifice as a vital aspect of reconciliation with God further strengthens the response. Overall, a well-articulated and thoughtful explanation within a Christian worldview."
