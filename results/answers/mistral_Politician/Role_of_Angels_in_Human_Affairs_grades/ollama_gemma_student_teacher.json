The breakdown of their functions as messengers, protectors, and executors of God's will is well-supported by relevant scriptures. Additionally, the student acknowledges the limitations of human understanding of angels and emphasizes their spiritual nature. The inclusion of an inclusive and respectful tone is commendable."
