The explanation emphasizes the importance of angels as messengers, protectors, and executors of God's will, reflecting a Christian worldview. However, to enhance the perspective from a Christian-specific worldview, more direct references to biblical passages could have been included to strengthen the argument. Additionally, connecting the roles of angels to how Christians perceive divine intervention in their lives could have been further elaborated upon to deepen the impact on one's faith perspective."
