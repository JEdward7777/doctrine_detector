  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the apostles' actions in teaching and fostering community among believers, emphasizing key aspects such as love, effective communication, commitment, and adaptability. However, the answer lacks direct reference to the specific actions of teaching, fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer highlighted in the reference answer. To improve, the student should relate their points back to these foundational aspects modeled by the apostles for a more focused and aligned response."
