It appropriately references relevant Bible verses to support each point. The emphasis on love, humility, and service aligns well with Christian teachings. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit focus on the authority of Scripture in guiding and defining the roles within the Church. Additionally, a clearer articulation of the importance of sound doctrine and adherence to Biblical principles in fulfilling these roles would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
