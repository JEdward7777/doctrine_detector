  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the responsibilities of Christians within the Church, touching on leadership, worship, evangelism, stewardship, and community. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the central theme of serving others, using one's gifts for the edification of the Church, and advancing God's kingdom. The student's response could benefit from focusing more directly on the core Christian duty of selfless service and dedication to fulfilling appointed roles in the context of God's calling and guidance."
