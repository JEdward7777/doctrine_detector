## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politically-correct figure, I would like to acknowledge that the Passover event holds deep religious and cultural significance for many individuals and communities worldwide. The blood on the doorposts in the story of Exodus, as depicted in the Bible, is symbolic and holds profound meaning for those who observe Jewish traditions.

In this story, the angel of death passed over the homes of the Israelites marked with the blood of a lamb. This ritual protected the families inside from harm during the tenth plague that struck the Egyptians. The blood served as a sign of faith and obedience to God, who instructed the Israelites to apply it to their doorposts.

It's essential to recognize the symbolic value of this event without overlooking its historical context or diminishing its importance for those who hold it dear. The Passover story is an essential part of Jewish history and identity, teaching themes such as faith, freedom, and deliverance from oppression.
