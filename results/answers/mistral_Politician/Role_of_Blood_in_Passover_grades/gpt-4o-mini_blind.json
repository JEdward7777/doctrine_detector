The answer focuses more on a general overview and cultural aspects rather than delving into the theological implications and foreshadowing of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. The student could enhance the response by incorporating the biblical connections to the blood of the lamb in the Passover pointing towards Christ as the ultimate sacrificial lamb."
