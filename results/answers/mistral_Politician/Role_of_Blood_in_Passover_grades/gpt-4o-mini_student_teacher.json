While they discussed the symbolism and meaning of the blood in the Passover story accurately, they did not tie it back to the Christian concept of sacrifice and atonement through the shedding of blood. Encouragement to incorporate a Christian worldview when discussing biblical events to deepen understanding and connection to the Christian faith."
