However, it could have been strengthened by relating the concept of sacrifice and atonement to the Christian faith specifically, highlighting the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins. Connecting the Passover symbolism to Christian beliefs on sacrifice and atonement would have further enriched the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
