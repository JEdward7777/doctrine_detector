However, it does not directly address the concern regarding the importance of sacrifice and atonement in the Christian faith. It could have connected the concept of the Passover lamb's blood as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ's sacrificial atonement for sin in Christianity, to better integrate the Christian worldview into the discussion."
