  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a well-reasoned historical analysis of the role of eunuchs in ancient societies without directly addressing the concern of understanding the value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom. While the student correctly highlights the practical functions eunuchs served, they do not make the connection to how God can use anyone to fulfill His purposes and plans in society, as outlined in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to incorporate a Christian worldview perspective into their analysis would strengthen their response."
