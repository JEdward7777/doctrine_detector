However, the response also emphasizes the practical societal reasons for the roles of eunuchs in ancient societies, rather than strictly focusing on how God can use individuals for His purposes. While the response provides valuable historical context, it could have tied more directly into how God's plan and purpose can transcend societal norms and expectations, specifically in the case of eunuchs."
