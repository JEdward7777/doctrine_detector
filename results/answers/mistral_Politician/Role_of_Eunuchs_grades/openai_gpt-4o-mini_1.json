While the historical context of eunuchs is well-analyzed, there is a missed opportunity to emphasize how God values and uses all individuals, regardless of physical or social status, in His kingdom. The response could benefit from incorporating more explicitly Christian perspectives on the intrinsic value of individuals, irrespective of societal roles or physical conditions, as part of God's redemptive plan."
