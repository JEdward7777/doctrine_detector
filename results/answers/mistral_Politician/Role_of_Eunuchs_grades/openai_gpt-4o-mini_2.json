  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the historical roles of eunuchs in ancient societies and highlights their importance, it falls short of fully addressing the concern from a Christian worldview. It does not explicitly connect the value and purpose of eunuchs to being part of God's kingdom or fulfilling His divine plan. To improve the grade, the response could have emphasized God's sovereignty in utilizing individuals of all physical or social statuses for His purposes, tying it back to the specific concern provided."
