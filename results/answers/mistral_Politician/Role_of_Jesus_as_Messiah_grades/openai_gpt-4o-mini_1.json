It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus' crucial role in fulfilling God's kingdom with righteousness. The inclusion of biblical references enhances the credibility of the response. However, to further enhance the Christian perspective, a more explicit connection to Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the centrality of his sacrificial death and resurrection for salvation could be beneficial."
