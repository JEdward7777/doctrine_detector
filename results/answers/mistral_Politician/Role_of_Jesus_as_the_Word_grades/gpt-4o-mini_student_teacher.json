  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively explains the significance of the title 'the Word of God' ascribed to Jesus within Christianity and acknowledges its roots in the Gospel of John. The student does a good job of highlighting Jesus' role in bridging humanity and divinity through this title. However, there is a slight deviation from the Christian specific worldview as the student does not explicitly emphasize Jesus being God Himself, which is a key aspect of recognizing Jesus' divinity. Overall, the answer is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
