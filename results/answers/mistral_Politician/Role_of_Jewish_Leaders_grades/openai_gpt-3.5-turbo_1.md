# Answer by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a historian, it's important to provide an accurate account of events while avoiding offensive language. The Jewish religious leaders, specifically the Sanhedrin, played a significant role in the trial and conviction of Jesus. However, it is crucial to understand that they did not have the authority to crucify anyone; that power was held by the Roman officials, such as Pontius Pilate.

The Gospel accounts suggest that the Jewish religious leaders accused Jesus of blasphemy (a crime under Mosaic law) and challenged His claims about being the Son of God. They believed these statements were against their religious beliefs and laws. When they brought Him to Roman authorities, the charges included sedition, claiming to be a king, and inciting rebellion against Romeâ€”all serious offenses punishable by death under Roman law.

It is essential to emphasize that the actions of the Jewish religious leaders should not be equated with contempt for or hatred towards all Jews, as their actions were taken in the context of their contemporary political and religious climate.
