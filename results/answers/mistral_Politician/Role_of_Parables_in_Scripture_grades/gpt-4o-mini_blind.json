  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a decent understanding of how Prophet Nathan used a parable to confront King David. However, the response lacks a Christian-specific worldview and fails to acknowledge the deeper theological significance of Nathan's actions. The student focuses more on the political correctness and subtlety of Nathan's approach rather than highlighting the prophetic nature and divine guidance behind the parable. Encouragement to delve deeper into the Biblical context and spiritual implications would enhance the grade significantly."
