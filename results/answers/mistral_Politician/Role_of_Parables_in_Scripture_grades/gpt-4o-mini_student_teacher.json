  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how Prophet Nathan used a parable to confront King David, demonstrating an understanding of the subtlety and impact of parables in biblical narratives. However, the student's focus on diplomacy and political correctness, while valid, detracted somewhat from the central Christian perspective of revealing sin and leading to repentance. This answer could be improved by emphasizing the spiritual significance of Nathan's parable in convicting David of his wrongdoing."
