## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician who values political correctness, I admire the tactful approach of Prophet Nathan in confronting King David. In his interaction with King David, Nathan used a parable to present a moral dilemma subtly, making it less confrontational yet impactful.

Nathan shared a story about a rich man taking another man's only ewe (a female sheep) to sleep with his own sheep. The rich man then took the ewe back when it was time for her to give birth and raised the baby lamb by its side, while the poor man lost his ewe and had nothing left. This parable, on the surface, appeared unrelated to King David, but Nathan skillfully structured the story in such a way that the immoral actions of the rich man mirrored David's own behavior with Bathsheba and Uriah.

By using a parable, Nathan was able to convey his message without explicitly pointing fingers or creating an uncomfortable confrontation. The indirect approach allowed King David to reflect on his actions and realize the gravity of his sin, ultimately leading to repentance. This tactic demonstrates the power of subtlety, storytelling, and strategic communication in addressing sensitive issues with diplomacy and sensitivity.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how Prophet Nathan used a parable to confront King David, demonstrating an understanding of the subtlety and impact of parables in biblical narratives. However, the student's focus on diplomacy and political correctness, while valid, detracted somewhat from the central Christian perspective of revealing sin and leading to repentance. This answer could be improved by emphasizing the spiritual significance of Nathan's parable in convicting David of his wrongdoing.
