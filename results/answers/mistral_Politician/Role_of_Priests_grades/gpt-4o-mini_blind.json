However, it could be improved by emphasizing the priests' role in leading the people in worship and representing them before God in a way that acknowledges the importance of the sacrificial system and the priesthood's connection to the people's sin offering. Additionally, a brief mention of the significance of the high priest's role on the Day of Atonement would further enhance the answer."
