  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed answer about the responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament according to the Bible. While the student included additional responsibilities beyond the reference answer, such as serving as intermediaries, maintaining the tabernacle, and administering justice, these aspects are valid and enhance the overall understanding of the priestly role. The response demonstrates a strong grasp of the biblical role of priests with accurate information and insights."
