However, it lacks the depth and specificity found in the original response which outlines additional crucial responsibilities such as enforcing purity, serving as intermediaries, maintaining the tabernacle/temple, and administering justice. To fully understand the biblical role of priests, it is important to recognize the multifaceted nature of their duties as outlined in the Old Testament."
