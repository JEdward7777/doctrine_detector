It accurately covers the offering of sacrifices and teaching God's laws but misses mentioning the priests' role as intermediaries between God and the people, enforcing moral and spiritual purity, and maintaining the tabernacle or temple. It could have been improved by incorporating these additional responsibilities to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the biblical role of priests."
