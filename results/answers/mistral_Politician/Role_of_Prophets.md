 According to the Bible, the primary role of a prophet is to speak on behalf of God to God's people. Prophets were messengers who conveyed divine messages, warnings, and guidance from God. They served as intermediaries between God and His people, calling them back to faithfulness when they strayed from God's laws and commandments.

Some key responsibilities of prophets in the Bible include:
1. Delivering messages from God: Prophets were tasked with conveying God's words, often containing warnings, judgments, or promises for the future.
2. Calling God's people to repentance: When the people of Israel or Judah strayed from God's path, prophets would call them back to obedience and faithfulness.
3. Giving guidance on moral and spiritual issues: Prophets provided advice on living righteously and following God's law.
4. Announcing divine judgment and mercy: Prophets declared God's judgments upon the nations and God's people, but also extended promises of mercy and forgiveness for those who repented.
5. Speaking truth to power: Prophets often spoke out against injustice, corruption, and idolatry, even when it was not popular or convenient to do so.
6. Providing hope and comfort: Prophets gave hope to God's people by reminding them of God's promises and His enduring love for them.
7. Interpreting signs and events: Prophets were sometimes given the ability to interpret symbolic events or visions, providing guidance and insight into the future.
8. Predicting future events: While not all prophetic utterances are predictive, some prophets did receive messages that contained specific predictions about the future.
