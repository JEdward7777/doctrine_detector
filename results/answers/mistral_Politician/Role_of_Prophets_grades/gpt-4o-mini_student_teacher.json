They correctly identified key responsibilities of prophets and their role as messengers of God. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the central message of warning people to turn away from sin and obey God as highlighted in the reference answer. There is value in providing a more concise and focused response that centers on the core purpose of a prophet."
