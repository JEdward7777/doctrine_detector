The response does not incorporate any biblical perspectives or theological insights regarding the Sadducees' beliefs and practices. Additionally, the mention of being a politician and striving for inclusivity to all faiths may dilute the focus on the specific doctrinal aspects of the Sadducees within Judaism. A more robust analysis from a Christian viewpoint with relevant Scriptures and doctrinal considerations would enhance the answer."
