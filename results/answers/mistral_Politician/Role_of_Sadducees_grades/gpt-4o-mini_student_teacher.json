However, there was a lack of emphasis on the religious and spiritual aspects of the Sadducees' role, focusing more on the political and administrative dimensions. Additionally, the response did not directly align with the Christian specific worldview in exploring the religious leadership context during the time of Jesus, as it did not delve into the spiritual significance of the priestly tasks performed by the Sadducees."
