# Answer by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician, I would ensure my response is accurate, respectful, and inclusive to all faiths, including Judaism. In the Jewish temple system during Second Temple Period (516 BC - 70 AD), the Sadducees were one of the two major Jewish sects, alongside the Pharisees. Their main responsibilities included:

1. Administration and management of the Jerusalem Temple, its cultic rituals, and sacrificial system. The Sadducees generally upheld a strict interpretation of the Torah as they believed in only the written law without oral traditions or interpretations.

2. Maintaining social order within the Jewish community, particularly during the pilgrimage festivals when large numbers of people would come to Jerusalem. They worked closely with the priests and Levites to ensure smooth functioning of the Temple system.

3. Collaboration with the Roman authorities, who held significant power over Judea during this time. This collaboration often led to conflict with other Jewish groups like the Pharisees, who advocated for greater independence from Roman rule.

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the main responsibilities of the Sadducees during the Second Temple Period, specifically in relation to managing the Jerusalem Temple, its rituals, and sacrificial system. The additional details on the Sadducees' collaboration with Roman authorities and their role in maintaining social order demonstrate a good understanding of the historical context of religious leadership during the time of Jesus. The response could have further emphasized the religious significance and implications of the Sadducees' responsibilities in the context of Judaism and their interactions with other Jewish sects, such as the Pharisees.
