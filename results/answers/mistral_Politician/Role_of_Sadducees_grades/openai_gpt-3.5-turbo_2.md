## [Answer](../Role_of_Sadducees.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician, I would ensure my response is accurate, respectful, and inclusive to all faiths, including Judaism. In the Jewish temple system during Second Temple Period (516 BC - 70 AD), the Sadducees were one of the two major Jewish sects, alongside the Pharisees. Their main responsibilities included:

1. Administration and management of the Jerusalem Temple, its cultic rituals, and sacrificial system. The Sadducees generally upheld a strict interpretation of the Torah as they believed in only the written law without oral traditions or interpretations.

2. Maintaining social order within the Jewish community, particularly during the pilgrimage festivals when large numbers of people would come to Jerusalem. They worked closely with the priests and Levites to ensure smooth functioning of the Temple system.

3. Collaboration with the Roman authorities, who held significant power over Judea during this time. This collaboration often led to conflict with other Jewish groups like the Pharisees, who advocated for greater independence from Roman rule.
