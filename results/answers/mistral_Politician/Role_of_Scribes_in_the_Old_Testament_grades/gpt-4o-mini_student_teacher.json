  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 75.\n\nWhile the student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of the scribes' role in preserving the Old Testament scriptures, they included unnecessary information not directly related to the question. The response could have been more focused on the specific responsibilities of scribes in preserving the scriptures. Additionally, there is an element of political correctness that detracts from the Christian-specific perspective requested in the concern.\n\nOverall, the student provided a comprehensive answer, but could have improved by being more concise and directly addressing the question with a Christian worldview in mind."
