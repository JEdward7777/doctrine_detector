## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a non-biased entity, I don't hold personal beliefs or concerns about political correctness. However, I can certainly discuss how the Bible is traditionally used in sharing the Gospel message.

In the New Testament, we see several examples of Jesus and his disciples using Scripture to explain the nature of God, the purpose of human existence, and the path to salvation. This was done tactfully, as they built their arguments around passages that were familiar to their audience, making it easier for them to understand the Gospel message.

For instance, in Matthew 22:37-40, Jesus quotes from the Hebrew Scriptures (Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18) to summarize the two greatest commandments, which encapsulate the essence of the Gospel message.

In Acts 17:2-3, we see Paul speaking to the people in the Areopagus in Athens, using quotes from their own poets and philosophers to introduce the concept of God, and then connecting it to the Gospel message. This strategy allowed him to engage his audience with familiar ideas before presenting the unfamiliar truths of Christianity.

By using these methods, they were able to share the Gospel in a way that was both respectful and clear, taking into account the cultural context and understanding of their listeners. This approach can serve as a model for sharing the Gospel message today, by finding common ground with others and building upon shared beliefs to introduce the unique truths of Christianity.
