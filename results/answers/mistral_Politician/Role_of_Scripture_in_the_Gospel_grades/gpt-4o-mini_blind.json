  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The response provides a generally accurate and insightful overview of how the Bible illustrates the use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message. However, it could be strengthened by incorporating more specific references to additional instances in the Bible where Scripture was used in evangelism. Additionally, the emphasis on cultural relevancy and connecting with the audience is commendable, but the response could benefit from a stronger focus on the centrality of Christ crucified and the need for repentance and faith in salvation. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, but further depth and clarity in connecting Scripture with the core message of the Gospel would enhance the response."
