  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of the integration of Scripture in sharing the Gospel by referencing specific examples from the New Testament. The student effectively explains how biblical passages were used strategically to communicate the Gospel message in a culturally relevant and respectful manner. However, the response could have been improved by directly addressing the concern and focusing on the role of Scripture in communicating the Gospel rather than tangential points."
