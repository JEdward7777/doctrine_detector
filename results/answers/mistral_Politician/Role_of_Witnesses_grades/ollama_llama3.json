  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear explanation of the role of witnesses in the New Testament, highlighting their importance in validating significant events related to Jesus's life and resurrection. The examples provided from the Gospels are relevant and support the argument. Additionally, the emphasis on the Resurrection as a pivotal witness account is well-taken.\n\nHowever, I deduct 15 points because this response does not directly address the concern of Christians witnessing their faith and sharing personal experiences with God's work in their lives. While it touches on the importance of witnesses in the New Testament, it does not explicitly connect this concept to modern-day Christian practice.\n\nTo improve, the response could incorporate more explicit connections between the biblical witness accounts and the call for contemporary Christians to share their own experiences of God's work in their lives."
