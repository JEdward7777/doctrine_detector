However, the introductory remark about rephrasing the question for political correctness is unnecessary and could be seen as insensitive to the religious context being discussed. It would be more appropriate to focus solely on addressing the question from a Christian worldview perspective. Additionally, the answer could benefit from incorporating specific references to the Old Testament scriptures where these roles and responsibilities are outlined, to bolster the theological foundation of the response."
