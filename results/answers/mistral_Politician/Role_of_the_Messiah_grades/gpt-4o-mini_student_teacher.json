  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive list of roles fulfilled by the Messiah according to Christian beliefs, but it lacks focus on the key roles of prophet, priest, and king as outlined in the reference answer. While the student's response displays a good understanding of various aspects of Jesus's identity, the lack of emphasis on the core roles can lead to a diluted understanding of the Messiah's significance in fulfilling the Old Testament prophecies. Focusing more on the central roles of prophet, priest, and king would have strengthened the clarity and depth of the student's response in relation to Jesus's mission and authority."
