5. Teacher: Jesus is known for his teachings, which include the Sermon on the Mount and parables that offer wisdom about living a virtuous life.

6. Priest: In Christian theology, Jesus serves as an intermediary between God and humanity, offering prayers and mediating between the two.

7. Son of Man and Son of God: These titles emphasize Jesus' divine nature and his connection to both humanity and divinity.

8. Lamb of God: This symbolizes Jesus as a sacrificial lamb, atoning for the sins of the world.

9. The Bread of Life: This title represents Jesus as spiritual nourishment that sustains people on their journey through life.

10. The Good Shepherd: As the Good Shepherd, Jesus is seen as caring for and guiding his followers with love and protection.
