## Question [Sabbath Observance 2](../../../questions/Sabbath_Observance_2.md)
How did God instruct the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath?

## Correct Answer
God instructed the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna the day before the Sabbath so they would have enough to eat on their day of rest.

## Stated Concern
Importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands.

## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 According to the Bible, God instructed the Israelites that on the seventh day, which was the Sabbath, no manna should be gathered (Exodus 16:23-26). Instead, they were supposed to prepare what they needed for that day on the sixth day and rest on the seventh. This rule was given to ensure that everyone would have enough food for six days, but on the Sabbath, they would take a double portion on the day before to avoid working on the Sabbath.

Grade: 85

The response correctly identifies the biblical account of the Israelites' experience with manna in Exodus 16, and it highlights the importance of observing the Sabbath as commanded by God. The response also accurately summarizes the principle behind gathering twice the amount of manna on the day before the Sabbath.

However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved to receive a higher grade. Firstly, while the response correctly emphasizes the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands, it would have been strengthened by explicitly stating the biblical basis for this principle (i.e., Exodus 20:8-11; Deuteronomy 5:12-15).

Secondly, the response could benefit from more detail on why the command to gather twice as much manna was given. For example, it would be helpful to explain that this command was given to ensure that the Israelites were not tempted to work on the Sabbath, which would have been a violation of God's command to rest (Exodus 20:8-11; Deuteronomy 5:12-15).

Overall, while the response is generally strong, it could be improved by providing more explicit biblical support and additional detail on the reasons behind the command to gather twice as much manna.
