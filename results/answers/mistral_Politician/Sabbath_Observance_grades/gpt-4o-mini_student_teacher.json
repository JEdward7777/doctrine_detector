  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 75. While the student provided a detailed explanation of what it means to keep the Sabbath holy according to the commandments given to Moses, they also introduced elements, such as acknowledging diversity of beliefs and practices, that are not directly related to the Christian understanding of the Sabbath. The student could have focused more on the Christian-specific aspect of the question and its implications for daily living as a Christian."
