## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath begins on Friday evening at sunset and ends on Saturday evening at sunset. This observance follows the commandment in Exodus 20:8-11, which states, "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns." The specific timing of sunset marks the transition from one day to the next in Jewish tradition.
