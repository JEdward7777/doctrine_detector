  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the beliefs of the Sadducees regarding resurrection and effectively contrasted it with Christian teachings. They demonstrated a respectful and inclusive approach, acknowledging the differences in beliefs between the two groups. However, to improve their grade, the student could have further emphasized the importance of these differences in shaping faith and the implications they have for one's worldview and understanding of salvation."
