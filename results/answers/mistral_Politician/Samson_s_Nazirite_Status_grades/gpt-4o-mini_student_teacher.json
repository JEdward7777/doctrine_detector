  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed explanation of Samson's Nazirite vow and highlighted key implications such as personal sacrifice, resilience, awareness of consequences, and spiritual connection, they did not directly address the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment as outlined in the concern. The student's response focused more on the general implications of the vow rather than specifically addressing the requested concern. \n\nThe student's response did show a good understanding of the story and its significance but missed the mark on directly tying it back to the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment. Therefore, there is room for improvement in aligning the response more closely with the concern provided."
