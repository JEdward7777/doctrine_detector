  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response does a good job of exploring the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in the biblical narrative of Samson through the lens of his Nazirite vow. The student effectively analyzes the implications of Samson's vow, highlighting themes of personal sacrifice, resilience, awareness of consequences, and spiritual connection. The response also connects these themes to broader contexts such as political decisions and personal growth. The analysis is thoughtful and demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview in interpreting biblical narratives."
