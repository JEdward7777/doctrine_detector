  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response does an excellent job of exploring the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives, specifically through the example of Samson's Nazirite vow. The student effectively connects the adherence to the vow with Samson's strength and the significance of personal sacrifice and resilience in fulfilling divine purposes. The response could be strengthened by further delving into the spiritual and cultural context surrounding Samson's vow, as well as providing more specific biblical references to support the analysis. Overall, a well-written and insightful perspective from a Christian worldview."
