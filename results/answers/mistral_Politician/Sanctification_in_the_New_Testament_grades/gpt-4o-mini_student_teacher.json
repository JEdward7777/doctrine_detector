  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the sanctification process in the New Testament, referencing key verses and explaining the gradual transformation believers undergo through the work of the Holy Spirit. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of sanctification, but could have been improved by explicitly connecting the role of faith in the process as highlighted in the concern. The student accurately communicates the essence of sanctification, but a more explicit emphasis on the role of faith would have strengthened the answer from a Christian perspective."
