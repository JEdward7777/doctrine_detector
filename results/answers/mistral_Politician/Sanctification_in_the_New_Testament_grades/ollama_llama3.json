The inclusion of relevant Scripture passages from Paul's letters (2 Corinthians 3:18 and Romans 6:4-5) is also a strength.\n\nHowever, to fully address the concern of recognizing the role of faith in the process of sanctification, the response could have explored this aspect more explicitly. For instance, it could have emphasized that faith is the means by which believers are united with Christ's death and resurrection (Romans 6:4-5), leading to their gradual transformation into Christlikeness.\n\nOverall, while the response provides a solid foundation for understanding sanctification, it could benefit from more direct attention on the role of faith in this process."
