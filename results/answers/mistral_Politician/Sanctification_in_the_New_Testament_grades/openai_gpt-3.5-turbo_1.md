## [Answer](../Sanctification_in_the_New_Testament.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the New Testament, the process of sanctification, or the process by which a Christian becomes more Christ-like, is described as a gradual transformation that occurs over time through the work of the Holy Spirit within the believer. This transformation is not something that happens instantly upon accepting Jesus, but rather it is a lifelong journey.

The apostle Paul describes this process in 2 Corinthians 3:18, where he writes, "And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit."

Additionally, in Romans 6:4-5, Paul writes, "We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his."

This passage suggests that through baptism and faith in Jesus, believers are united with Christ in his death and resurrection, and as a result, they can live a new life and be transformed by the Holy Spirit.

It is important to note that this process of sanctification is not something that happens automatically or without effort on the part of the believer. Instead, it requires active participation, prayer, obedience, and a willingness to follow God's will for one's life.

Overall, the New Testament describes the process of sanctification as a gradual, lifelong transformation that occurs through the work of the Holy Spirit within the believer, as they seek to follow Jesus and live in accordance with his teachings.
