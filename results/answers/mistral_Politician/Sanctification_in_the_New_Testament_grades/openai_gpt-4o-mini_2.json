  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively expands upon the given answer by providing thorough biblical references and explanations regarding the process of sanctification in the New Testament. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the role of faith in sanctification and emphasizes the need for believers to actively participate, pray, obey, and follow God's will in their journey towards becoming more Christ-like. The only slight room for improvement would be to explicitly connect the journey of sanctification to faith in Jesus throughout the response."
