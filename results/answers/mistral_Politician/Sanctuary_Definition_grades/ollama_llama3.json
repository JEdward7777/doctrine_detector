It also mentions the Tabernacle and Temple in Jerusalem as examples of this concept. However, the response could be more comprehensive and detailed in its explanation of the term's meaning and significance in the biblical context. Additionally, while the response touches on the modern metaphorical use of \"sanctuary,\" it could delve deeper into the connections between these different meanings.\n\nThe concern was to understand the meaning and significance of the term 'sanctuary' in the Biblical context, which this response partially addresses. While it provides some relevant information, it could be more thorough and detailed in its exploration of the concept within the biblical narrative."
