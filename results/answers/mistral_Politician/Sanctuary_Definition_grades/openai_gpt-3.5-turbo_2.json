However, there is a lack of depth in explaining the theological significance of sanctuaries in Christianity. The mention of modern contexts and political correctness detracts from the focus on the Biblical meaning. It would have been stronger if the response delved deeper into the Biblical references to sanctuaries and their spiritual importance."
