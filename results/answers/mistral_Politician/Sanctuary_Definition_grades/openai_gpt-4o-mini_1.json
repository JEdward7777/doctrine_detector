However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of sanctuary within Christianity, such as the concept of God's presence and protection in sanctuaries. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to emphasize how the term aligns with Christian beliefs and practices, particularly in relation to seeking refuge and safety in God."
