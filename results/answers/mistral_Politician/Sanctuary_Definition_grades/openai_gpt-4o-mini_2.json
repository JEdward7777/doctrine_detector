However, the subsequent elaboration on the term in modern contexts, particularly in relation to immigration policy and politically correct considerations, drifts away from the primary concern of understanding the Biblical meaning and significance of \"sanctuary.\" The response could have delved deeper into the Biblical understanding of sanctuary without introducing unrelated contexts."
