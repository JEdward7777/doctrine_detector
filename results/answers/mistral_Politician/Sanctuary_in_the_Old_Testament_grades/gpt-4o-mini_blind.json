  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of how God described the sanctuary in relation to His people in the Old Testament. The student accurately describes the sanctuary as a sacred place for worship and emphasizes its significance as a tangible representation of God's presence among His people. The inclusion of specific examples such as the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, and the golden lampstand demonstrates an understanding of the symbolic meanings within the sanctuary. The comparison to a modern-day church or religious institution also helps to contextualize the concept for contemporary readers. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
