  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good understanding of the sanctuary in the Old Testament, highlighting its significance as a place of worship and symbolic representations of God's presence among His people. However, there was a lack of emphasis on the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people, which was the specific concern provided. The student could have included more direct references to God describing the sanctuary as His dwelling place and a place of safety for the Israelites to align more closely with the Christian worldview."
