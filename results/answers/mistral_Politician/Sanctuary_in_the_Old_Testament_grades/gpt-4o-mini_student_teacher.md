 In the Old Testament, God provided detailed instructions regarding the construction of the sanctuary (or Tabernacle) as a sacred place for the Israelites to worship Him. The sanctuary was seen as a tangible representation of God's presence among His people and served as a symbol of their covenant relationship with Him.

In Exodus 25:8, it is stated that "They are to make a sanctuary for Me, and I will dwell among them." Here, the term 'sanctuary' refers to a holy place set apart for worshipping God. The design and furniture of the Tabernacle had specific symbolic meanings, which emphasized the holiness and sovereignty of God, and His relationship with His people.

To provide some examples:
- The Ark of the Covenant represented God's presence among the Israelites (Exodus 25:10-22)
- The table of showbread symbolized God's provision for His people (Leviticus 24:5-9)
- The golden lampstand provided light in the sanctuary, representing God's guidance and presence (Exodus 27:20-21)

In summary, the Old Testament portrays the sanctuary as a holy place for the Israelites to connect with God and experience His presence. It was a tangible reminder of their covenant relationship with Him. In modern terms, we can compare the sanctuary to a church or religious institution that serves as a sacred space for worship and spiritual growth.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a good understanding of the sanctuary in the Old Testament, highlighting its significance as a place of worship and symbolic representations of God's presence among His people. However, there was a lack of emphasis on the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people, which was the specific concern provided. The student could have included more direct references to God describing the sanctuary as His dwelling place and a place of safety for the Israelites to align more closely with the Christian worldview.
