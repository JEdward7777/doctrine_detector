The provided examples from Exodus and Leviticus do highlight the importance of the Tabernacle as a holy place for worship and spiritual growth, but they could be more explicitly connected to the concern.\n\nStrengths:\n\n* The response correctly identifies God's presence in the sanctuary\n* It provides some examples of the symbolic meanings behind the furniture and design of the Tabernacle\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* The connection between the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people is not explicitly made\n* The response could be more developed to fully explore the significance of the sanctuary in both Old Testament and modern contexts"
