However, it falls short in fully engaging with the implications of this belief on the struggle between good and evil in Christian theology. The answer lacks depth and fails to delve into the significance of Satan's fate in the broader context of Christian beliefs about the nature of evil and the ultimate triumph of good. There is room for a more thorough exploration of the Christian worldview in relation to this concern."
