However, it fails to address the concern raised specifically about the implications for understanding the struggle between good and evil in Christian theology. From a Christian perspective, the failure to acknowledge the significance of Satan's ultimate fate in the context of spiritual warfare and the battle between good and evil impacts the overall understanding of Christian beliefs and teachings."
