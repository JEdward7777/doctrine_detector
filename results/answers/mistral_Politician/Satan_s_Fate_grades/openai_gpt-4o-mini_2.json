While the response does not directly address the Christian view that Satan and evil spirits will be thrown into hell for eternal punishment, it does recognize the broader implications of this belief for understanding the struggle between good and evil in Christian theology. Some more explicit engagement with the Christian perspective on this issue would have strengthened the response and better addressed the concern provided."
