  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided relevant Bible verses that highlight the concept of intercession and its importance, their response included verses that were not directly related to intercession for others. The primary concern was to encourage believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. The student's answer somewhat met the concern by providing verses that showcase intercessory prayer, but they could have focused more on the specific act of interceding for others based on the teacher's reference answer."
