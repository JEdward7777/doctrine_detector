  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response is strong in several areas. First, it provides relevant biblical examples that demonstrate the concept of intercession, which aligns well with the concern to encourage believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. The inclusion of various passages from different books of the Bible (Romans, 1 Timothy, Hebrews, Jeremiah, and Exodus) showcases the significance of intercession throughout the Scriptures.\n\nThe response is also commendable in its attempt to illustrate Jesus' role as an intercessor between God and humanity, highlighting His constant intercession on behalf of those who come to God through Him (Hebrews 7:25-26).\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because this response does not explicitly address the provided answer. While it does mention Hebrews 7:25-26 as an example of Jesus' intercession, it does not directly connect this passage to the concern about encouraging believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession.\n\nOverall, this response provides valuable biblical examples and insights into the concept of intercession, but could be strengthened by more explicitly addressing the provided answer and concern."
