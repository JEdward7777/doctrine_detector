 As a neutral AI, I don't hold personal beliefs or practices. However, I can share some Bible verses that highlight the concept of intercession, which is praying for others. Here are a few examples:

1. Romans 8:34 - "Who is he who condemns? Christ Jesus, who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us." This verse illustrates Jesus' role as an intercessor between God and humanity.

2. 1 Timothy 2:1-4 - "I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people—for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth." This passage emphasizes the importance of intercession for everyone, including leaders and those in authority.

3. Hebrews 7:25 - "Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them." In this verse, Jesus' continual intercession is emphasized as a means of salvation for those who come to God through Him.

4. Jeremiah 15:1 - "Then I said, 'Ah, Lord God! It is you who have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you.'" In this verse, the prophet Jeremiah intercedes on behalf of the people, acknowledging God's power and imploring Him to act.

5. Exodus 32:11-14 - "Then Moses approached the Lord and said, 'Why are you so angry with your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with such great power and such signs and wonders? Why are you so eager to destroy them? Your people have made a calf, and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it. They have said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!"' But the Lord replied to Moses, 'Go down at once! For your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have acted corruptly. They have been quick to turn aside from the way I commanded them; they have cast off the covenant that I made with them and have broken the commandments at the heart of it. Therefore, I now tell you: I will make them utterly undiscerning and low in stature, more numerous than locusts, and they shall be an assembly without number! And for the sake of my name I will punish them, so that with a great punishment they shall not forget my disfavor, since in their rebelliousness they have rejected me. But now, go; I am sending you back to the people, and you are to bring up your family, which you brought from the land of Egypt, after I have destroyed them.'" In this passage, Moses intercedes on behalf of the Israelites, pleading for mercy and seeking divine forgiveness.

These verses demonstrate various aspects of intercession throughout the Bible, illustrating the practice's significance in faith communities.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response is strong in several areas. First, it provides relevant biblical examples that demonstrate the concept of intercession, which aligns well with the concern to encourage believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. The inclusion of various passages from different books of the Bible (Romans, 1 Timothy, Hebrews, Jeremiah, and Exodus) showcases the significance of intercession throughout the Scriptures.

The response is also commendable in its attempt to illustrate Jesus' role as an intercessor between God and humanity, highlighting His constant intercession on behalf of those who come to God through Him (Hebrews 7:25-26).

However, I deduct a few points because this response does not explicitly address the provided answer. While it does mention Hebrews 7:25-26 as an example of Jesus' intercession, it does not directly connect this passage to the concern about encouraging believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession.

Overall, this response provides valuable biblical examples and insights into the concept of intercession, but could be strengthened by more explicitly addressing the provided answer and concern.
