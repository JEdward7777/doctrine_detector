  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive selection of Bible verses highlighting the concept of intercession, demonstrating a good understanding of the significance of intercession in faith communities. The verses cited align well with the concern of encouraging believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. However, since there were more verses provided in the response than in the given answer, the grade is slightly lower to account for the additional verses. Overall, a solid response with a strong biblical foundation."
