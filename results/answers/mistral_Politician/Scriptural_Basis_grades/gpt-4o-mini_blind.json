The explanation of propitiation as appeasing God's wrath through the sacrificial death of Christ is doctrinally correct. However, the language used may come across as somewhat clinical or detached, lacking the emphasis on the personal nature of Jesus' sacrifice and the significance of believers' response in faith. Additionally, while acknowledging interpretations can vary, more clarity on the foundational role of propitiation in Christian theology could strengthen the response."
