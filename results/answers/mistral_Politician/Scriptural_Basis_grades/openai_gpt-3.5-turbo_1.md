 As a responsibly neutral AI, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations. However, I can provide you with Bible verses that discuss propitiation, which is a concept significant in understanding atonement and reconciliation between God and humanity in Christian theology.

Propitiation (Greek: hilasmos) generally refers to the act of appeasing or conciliating an offended deity by expiation for sin, typically through the sacrificial death of Christ. Here are some verses that discuss propitiation:

1. Romans 3:25 - "God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood." (NIV)
2. 1 John 2:2 - "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world." (NIV)
3. 1 John 4:10 - "This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins." (NIV)
4. Romans 5:8-9 - "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved through him from the wrath of God." (NIV)

These verses emphasize that Jesus' sacrifice was propitiatory, meaning it served to appease God's wrath and make atonement for our sins. However, interpretations can vary among different Christian denominations and individuals, so it is essential to consider the context in which these verses are studied and discussed.
