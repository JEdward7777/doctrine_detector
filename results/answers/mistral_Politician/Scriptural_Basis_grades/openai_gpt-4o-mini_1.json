  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a very thorough explanation of the concept of propitiation in Christian theology, supported by relevant Bible verses. The biblical references provided align closely with the concept of Jesus being the propitiation for our sins, as highlighted in the given answer. The response effectively connects the theological concept with specific verses, enhancing the understanding of atonement and reconciliation in Christian belief. Great job in incorporating both explanation and biblical references to support the discussion."
