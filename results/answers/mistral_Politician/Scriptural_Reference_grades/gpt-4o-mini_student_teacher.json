  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer highlighting relevant Bible passages that address the relationship between believers and the world. While the student provided additional verses beyond what the teacher referenced, the key passages specified by the teacher were not included. Encouraging the student to focus more on the specific verses mentioned in the teacher's reference answer would have been beneficial. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic."
