## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a helpful and respectful assistant, I will provide you with several passages from the Bible that discuss the relationship between believers and the world. It is essential to remember that interpretations can vary, but here are some well-known verses:

1. John 3:16 (New International Version): "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." This passage underscores God's love for all of humanity, often referred to as 'the world.'

2. 1 John 2:15-17 (New International Version): "Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in them. For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever." This passage advises believers to be cautious about becoming too attached to worldly things.

3. Romans 12:2 (New Living Translation): "Don't copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good, meaningful, and satisfying." This passage encourages believers to seek God's will rather than conforming to the ways of the world.

4. Colossians 3:1-2 (New International Version): "Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things." This passage emphasizes that believers should focus their thoughts and actions on spiritual matters rather than worldly concerns.

5. 2 Corinthians 5:17 (New Living Translation): "This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!" This passage highlights the transformation that occurs in a believer's life as they are united with Christ.

These passages show how the Bible discusses the relationship between believers and the world, offering guidance on how to live in accordance with God's will.
