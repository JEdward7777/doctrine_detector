  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response provides a thoughtful and well-organized discussion of several key Bible passages related to the relationship between believers and the world. The writer highlights the importance of not loving the world (1 John 2:15) and encourages readers to seek God's will rather than conforming to worldly values (Romans 12:2). The inclusion of passages that emphasize transformation in a believer's life (Colossians 3:1-2, 2 Corinthians 5:17) is also relevant to the concern about navigating life as a believer in a world with ungodly values.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response does not directly address how believers can navigate life in a world characterized by ungodly values. While the passages discussed do provide some guidance on this topic, the writer could have done more to explicitly connect these passages to the concern and offer practical advice or applications for readers.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of relevant Bible passages and their implications for believers living in a world with ungodly values."
