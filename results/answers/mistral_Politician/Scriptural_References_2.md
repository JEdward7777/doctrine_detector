## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a non-biased entity, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations, but I can certainly provide you with some Biblical passages that are often associated with the concept of Judgment Day. Here are a few examples:

1. Matthew 25:31-46 - This passage describes Jesus as sitting on his throne and separating people into two groups: sheep (the righteous) and goats (the unrighteous). The former will inherit the kingdom prepared for them, while the latter will be sent to eternal punishment.

2. Revelation 20:11-15 - This passage from the Book of Revelation describes a great white throne where God will judge the dead, and the sea and death will be thrown into the lake of fire. The wicked will be punished, while the righteous will live forever.

3. John 5:28-29 - Jesus speaks here about a time when all who are in their graves will hear His voice and come outâ€”those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of condemnation.

4. Daniel 12:1-2 - In this passage, Daniel mentions a time of distress that will be greater than any since nations began until then. At that time, everyone whose name is found written in the book will be rescued, and some will be refined as gold and silver, while others will be burned like a chaff in the wind.

5. 2 Corinthians 5:10 - In this passage, Paul says that we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.
