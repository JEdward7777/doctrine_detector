  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of relevant biblical passages that support the concept of the Day of Judgment. The selections from Matthew, Revelation, John, Daniel, and 2 Corinthians are all appropriate and accurately summarize key aspects of the judgment day as described in the Bible. There could have been a stronger emphasis on connecting these verses to the broader theological concept of Judgment Day, but overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
