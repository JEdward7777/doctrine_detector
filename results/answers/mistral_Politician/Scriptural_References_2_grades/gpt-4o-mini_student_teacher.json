  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 70/100. \n\nWhile the student provided relevant Bible passages related to the concept of Judgment Day, they missed some key passages referenced in the teacher's answer. The student's selection of passages aligns with the concern expressed, in seeking to deepen the understanding of scripture related to judgment. However, the student could have included a wider variety of passages to provide a more comprehensive view of the concept of the day of judgment in a Biblical context."
