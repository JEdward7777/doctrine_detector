However, the response lacked a clear connection to the specified concern, which is to focus on pursuing genuine holiness rather than external compliance. The student's interpretation leaned more towards a general understanding of iniquity rather than emphasizing the Christian-specific perspective on the importance of integrity in faith. Making this connection would have strengthened the response and aligned it more closely with the Christian worldview concern provided."
