  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides a clear summary of Matthew 23:27-28, highlighting the themes of iniquity being hidden from public view, contaminating individuals or groups, leading to spiritual decay, and the importance of examining one's heart and actions. The response also acknowledges the importance of addressing iniquity and uprooting it to maintain integrity.\n\nThe concern about pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance is partially addressed, as the response notes that \"true character should not be judged by appearances alone\" and emphasizes the need for introspection, repentance, and spiritual growth. However, the connection between the passage and the concern is not fully developed, and the response could benefit from a more explicit exploration of how Matthew 23:27-28 speaks to this issue.\n\nOverall, while the response provides a good summary of the passage, it could be strengthened by further developing the connection to the concern about pursuing genuine holiness."
