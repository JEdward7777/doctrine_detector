However, the response falls short in directly addressing the concern of pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards from a Christian worldview. There is a missed opportunity to emphasize the significance of inner righteousness stemming from a transformed heart rather than just outward appearances. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the teachings in the passage to the importance of genuine holiness and the transformative power of faith in Christ."
