However, the response could have emphasized more explicitly the Christian worldview perspective on the significance of true inner righteousness and the detrimental effects of iniquity on the spiritual life of individuals and the community. Additionally, while the response avoids making personal interpretations or theological statements, it could have integrated more Christian-specific principles or teachings to provide a deeper analysis from a Christian worldview."
