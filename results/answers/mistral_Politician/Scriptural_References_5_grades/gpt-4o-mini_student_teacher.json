However, they missed focusing on the contrast between Hades and 'paradise' for the righteous as highlighted in Luke 23:43, which was pointed out in the reference answer. This distinction is crucial in grasping the complete shift in the view of Hades within the New Testament. Additional elaboration on this point would have strengthened the answer."
