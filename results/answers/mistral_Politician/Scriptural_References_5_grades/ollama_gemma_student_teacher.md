## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_5.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or biases, but I can certainly help you find verses that might indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades from a neutral place for all the dead to a location associated with the unrighteous.

1. Luke 16:23: "And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom." This verse seems to suggest that Hades (often translated as 'hell' in this passage) is a place of torment for the unrighteous.

2. Acts 2:31: "He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, neither did His flesh see corruption." Here, Hades is associated with the state of death, and it's implied that Jesus, being righteous, did not remain there.

3. 1 Peter 3:19: "By which also He went and preached to the spirits in prison," suggests a division between righteous and unrighteous spirits in Hades.

4. Revelation 20:13-14: "And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works." This passage seems to imply that there is a distinction between the righteous and unrighteous in Hades/Death.
