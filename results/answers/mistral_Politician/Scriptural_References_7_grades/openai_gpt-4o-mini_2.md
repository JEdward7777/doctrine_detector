## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_7.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In addressing your question, I would like to provide a balanced and respectful interpretation of these Bible passages as they relate to the concept of exaltation within the Christian faith.

1 Peter 5:5-7 offers guidance for leaders within the Christian community, emphasizing humility as a necessary quality for those in positions of authority. Verse 6 states, "Humble yourselves, therefore, under Godâ€™s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time." This verse illustrates that exaltation is not achieved through self-promotion or pride but rather through humility and submission to God's will.

In contrast, Philippians 2:9-11 extols the ultimate exaltation of Jesus Christ, who, despite being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used for His own advantage; instead, He made himself nothing by taking on the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. As a result, God highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

Taken together, these passages emphasize two aspects of exaltation:

1. Exaltation through humility: As followers of Jesus Christ, we are called to emulate His selfless attitude of humility and service, recognizing that true exaltation comes from submitting ourselves to God's will.
2. Exaltation through redemption: The ultimate exaltation is given to Jesus Christ, who humbled Himself for our sake and was exalted by God the Father as a demonstration of love, mercy, and justice. In acknowledging Jesus as Lord, we participate in the ongoing redemptive work of God in the world.

By embracing these teachings, we can strive to live lives that embody humility while also celebrating the exaltation of Christ and the transformative power of His sacrifice for all people.
