  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided an insightful answer with appropriate scriptural references that emphasize striving for a blameless life according to Christian teachings. However, the student could have benefitted from including some of the key references such as 1 Thessalonians 2:10, 2 Peter 3:14, and Philippians 2:15 provided by the teacher. Nonetheless, the student effectively explained how these verses can guide a Christian's life towards holiness and aligning with God's character."
