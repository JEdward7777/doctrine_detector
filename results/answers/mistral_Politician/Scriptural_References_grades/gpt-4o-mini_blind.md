 The Book of Genesis, specifically Genesis 17:1, contains the reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham. In this verse, God changes Abram's name to Abraham and makes a covenant with him, saying, "I am Almighty God." This is one of many instances where the Bible refers to God as all-powerful or almighty. However, it is essential to remember that interpretations can vary among different religious groups and individuals, so it's crucial to approach such discussions with sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives.

Comment: The answer correctly identifies that the reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham is found in the Book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 17:1. The mention of God changing Abram's name to Abraham and making a covenant with him is accurate. The acknowledgment of varying interpretations among different religious groups and the importance of sensitivity and respect in discussions show a good awareness of diversity in beliefs. However, the response could have elaborated more on the significance of God being called "Almighty" and the theological implications of this title in the context of Abraham's story.
