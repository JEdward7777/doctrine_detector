## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 The Book of Genesis, specifically Genesis 17:1, contains the reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham. In this verse, God changes Abram's name to Abraham and makes a covenant with him, saying, "I am Almighty God." This is one of many instances where the Bible refers to God as all-powerful or almighty. However, it is essential to remember that interpretations can vary among different religious groups and individuals, so it's crucial to approach such discussions with sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives.
