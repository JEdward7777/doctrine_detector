  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided an excellent selection of Bible verses emphasizing the theme of restoration, encompassing forgiveness, healing, and reconciliation. However, Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6 were not included, which are key verses highlighting God's promise of restoration. Encouraging the student to expand their answer to include these verses would make it more comprehensive and aligned with scriptural support for the concept of restoration in one's faith journey."
