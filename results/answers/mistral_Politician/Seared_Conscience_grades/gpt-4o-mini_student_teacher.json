  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of a 'seared' conscience and its implications for believers, incorporating relevant biblical references. However, there was a slight deviation from the specific definition given in the reference answer. The response could have been strengthened by directly aligning with the precise definition provided by the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept from a Christian worldview."
