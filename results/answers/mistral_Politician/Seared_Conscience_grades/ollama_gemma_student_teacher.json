  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of a 'seared' conscience and its implications for a believer. They accurately define the term and provide relevant biblical references to support their explanation. Additionally, they effectively explain how a hardened conscience can lead to moral compromise and spiritual decline. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the importance of repentance and renewal of the conscience."
