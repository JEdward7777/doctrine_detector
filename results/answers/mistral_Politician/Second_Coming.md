## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician, I would strive to respect all religious beliefs, including those of Christians who interpret the Bible. In the context of your question, the Son of Man refers to Jesus himself in various parts of the New Testament. The statement that the Son of Man will come back on the clouds is found in several passages, such as Matthew 24:30, Mark 13:26, and Luke 21:27.

This belief, shared by many Christians, suggests a future Second Coming of Christ, where he will return to Earth, often symbolized by his arrival on the clouds. For believers, this event implies a time of fulfillment and judgment, as well as the establishment of God's kingdom on Earth. It's essential to remember that everyone's interpretation of religious texts can vary, and it is crucial to maintain respect for those differences in any discourse.
