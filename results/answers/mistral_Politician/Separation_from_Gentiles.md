## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As devout Jewish leaders during the Second Temple period, the Pharisees adhered to a set of religious laws and customs that distinguished them from other cultures, particularly the Gentiles (non-Jews). These laws were central to their identity and way of life.

Separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles was important for several reasons:

1. **Religious Identity**: The Pharisees believed in the superiority of Jewish religious practices, which they saw as divinely ordained. They sought to preserve these practices, which were often different from those of the Gentiles.

2. **Purity Laws**: The Pharisees followed a set of dietary and purity laws that dictated what could be eaten, who could be married, and how one should interact with the dead. These laws served to maintain a sense of spiritual purity and separation from non-Jewish customs.

3. **Preservation of Jewish Culture**: The Pharisees aimed to preserve the unique Jewish culture and traditions, which they believed were given by God. Intermingling with Gentiles could potentially dilute these traditions.

4. **Political Stability**: The Pharisees may have also been concerned about political stability in a region where cultural differences could lead to conflict. By maintaining separation, they could help prevent cultural clashes that might destabilize their community and society at large.

5. **Religious Integrity**: Lastly, the Pharisees were deeply committed to religious integrity. They saw themselves as guardians of Jewish law and traditions, and by keeping away from Gentiles, they believed they could uphold these values more effectively.
