However, it fails to delve deeply into the specific theological and doctrinal implications of the rainbow as a sign of God's covenant with humanity in Genesis. The response also lacks clarity on the biblical context and focuses more on modern interpretations rather than theological significance. More emphasis on the biblical narrative and theological significance of the rainbow in relation to God's covenant with humanity would have strengthened the response."
