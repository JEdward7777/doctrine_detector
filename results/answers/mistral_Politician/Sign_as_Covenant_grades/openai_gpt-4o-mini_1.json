  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on the symbolism of the rainbow as a reminder of God's covenant and promise in the Bible. The candidate effectively connects the rainbow to the story of Noah and the great flood in Genesis, demonstrating a clear comprehension of this biblical event. The response appropriately highlights the religious significance of the rainbow as a symbol of God's mercy and faithfulness. However, a minor deduction is made because the candidate also discusses the modern interpretation of the rainbow as a symbol of diversity and inclusion without fully emphasizing the primary biblical context."
