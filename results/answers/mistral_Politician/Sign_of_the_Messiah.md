## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician who values inclusivity, I would like to highlight the significance of the sign given to the shepherds in Luke regarding the birth of Jesus. This event serves as a powerful symbol of inclusivity and unity, as it was the shepherds, often considered an overlooked or marginalized group in society during that time, who were the first to receive news about the birth of Jesus Christ.

The shepherds were told to "Go and tell everyone what you have seen and heard," (Luke 2:17) which indicates that the message of Jesus' birth was meant for all people, regardless of their social status or background. This story reminds us that the Christmas message is one of love, peace, and goodwill towards all people, a sentiment we should strive to uphold in our own actions and decisions as members of society today.

Additionally, it's important to note that this event occurred during Hanukkah, which was not only a Jewish holiday but also a celebration of religious freedom and rededication. By having Jesus be born during this time, the Bible demonstrates the universal nature of God's love for all people, regardless of their religious beliefs or practices.

In conclusion, the sign given to the shepherds in Luke serves as an important reminder that the message of Jesus' birth is one of inclusivity and unity for all people, regardless of their background, status, or religion. It encourages us to embrace diversity, promote understanding, and work towards a society where everyone feels valued and included.
