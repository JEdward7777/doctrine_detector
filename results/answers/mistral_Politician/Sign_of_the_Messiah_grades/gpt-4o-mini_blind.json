However, the student misses the key significance of the sign given to the shepherds being a direct revelation of the Messiah's birth, a pivotal moment in Christian theology. The focus on inclusivity, while important, overshadows the centrality of Christ's birth and its impact on salvation. In a Christian worldview, it is crucial to highlight Jesus as the focal point of the sign to the shepherds and the message of hope and redemption He brings to humanity."
