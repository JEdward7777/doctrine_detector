However, the answer strays too far from the specific concern of recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs. The student fails to directly address the significance of the sign itself in relation to prophecy fulfillment and the broader plan of God. The answer would have been stronger if it had focused more on the specific sign given to the shepherds and its deeper theological implications."
