However, it lacks depth and fails to delve into the theological meanings and implications of anointing within the Christian worldview. The answer could benefit from a more robust explanation of how anointing reflects the chosen-ness, authority, and empowerment of these individuals by God, as well as the prophetic symbolism of anointing in pointing to Jesus as the ultimate Anointed One. Additionally, references to Scripture or specific examples from the Old Testament could strengthen the argument."
