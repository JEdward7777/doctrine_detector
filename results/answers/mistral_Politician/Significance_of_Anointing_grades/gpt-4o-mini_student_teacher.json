  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 70.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of anointing in the context of Old Testament priests, kings, and prophets. They correctly highlight that anointing symbolized consecration and divine favor, and they also mention the specific roles of priests, kings, and prophets in relation to anointing. The student also connects the concept of anointing to modern leadership principles, emphasizing accountability and divine guidance.\n\nHowever, the student's answer lacks conciseness and clarity compared to the reference answer provided by the teacher. While the student provides additional context and elaboration, they could have presented their points more succinctly to align closely with the specific concern regarding the importance of anointing in biblical leadership roles. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but could improve on focus and precision in their response."
