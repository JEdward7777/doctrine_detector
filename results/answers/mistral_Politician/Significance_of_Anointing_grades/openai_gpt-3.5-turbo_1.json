The answer demonstrates an understanding of the biblical principles underlying anointing in biblical leadership roles and relates it effectively to modern-day implications. The only area for improvement would be to include a brief mention of the spiritual symbolism of anointing in connection to the Christian belief in being consecrated for God's service."
