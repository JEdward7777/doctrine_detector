  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response completely misses the mark in addressing the significance of 'Shaddai' being translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations. It fails to provide any theological or doctrinal insight from a Christian worldview. The student's focus on political correctness and cultural sensitivity detracts from the essential theological implications and significance of the term 'Shaddai' in biblical context. A correct Christian worldview would emphasize the power, supremacy, and provision associated with the title 'Shaddai' in relation to God, rather than merely focusing on cultural diversity and interfaith dialogue."
