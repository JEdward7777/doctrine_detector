  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not align with a Christian worldview. Their focus on cultural diversity and inclusivity, although important, shifts the significance away from the intended deepening of understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. The answer lacks a theological perspective on the nature of God and does not address the specific concern provided."
