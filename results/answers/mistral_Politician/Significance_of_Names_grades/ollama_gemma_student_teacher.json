  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Demonstrates sensitivity to cultural diversity and religious sensitivity.\n* Highlights the importance of inclusivity and open-mindedness in translation.\n* Promotes interfaith dialogue and peacebuilding.\n* Acknowledges the historical significance of the term within different communities.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Lacks specific theological insight into the meaning of 'Shaddai' as a title or name.\n* Does not directly address the concern of deepening understanding of God's character and relational aspect.\n\n**Areas for improvement:**\n\n* The student could benefit from further research and theological analysis of the specific significance of 'Shaddai' within biblical contexts.\n* The response would be stronger if it explicitly connected the translation choices with Christian beliefs about God's character and attributes.\n\nOverall, this is a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of cultural sensitivity and inclusivity in translation. However, it would benefit from additional theological depth to fully address the concern of deepening understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith."
