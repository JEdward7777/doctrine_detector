  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful perspective on the importance of understanding 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name in Bible translations from a cultural diversity and religious sensitivity standpoint. However, it falls short of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith, which was the specified concern. The response does not directly address how translating 'Shaddai' as a title or name influences the Christian understanding of God's attributes and relational nature. To improve the grade, the response could have integrated more Christian-specific teachings on the significance of names and titles in relation to understanding God's character and fostering a personal relationship with Him."
