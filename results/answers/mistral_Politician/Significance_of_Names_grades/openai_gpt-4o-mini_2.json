Instead, it focuses on cultural sensitivity and inclusivity without emphasizing the theological significance of 'Shaddai' as it relates to God's attributes and personal relationship with Him. The perspective presented lacks a Christian-specific worldview and does not prioritize the core beliefs of the Christian faith."
