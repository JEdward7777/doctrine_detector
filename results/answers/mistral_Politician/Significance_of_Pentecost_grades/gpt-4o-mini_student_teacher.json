However, there is a lack of emphasis on the central role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers for ministry, which is a crucial aspect when understanding the significance of Pentecost. Additionally, the answer prioritizes inclusivity and diversity over the theological significance of the Holy Spirit's role in believers' lives. The student should focus more on the scriptural foundation and Christian worldview aspect of the Holy Spirit's empowering presence in believers."
