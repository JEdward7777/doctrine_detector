Additionally, the student acknowledges the diverse beliefs and traditions surrounding unleavened bread, demonstrating sensitivity to different perspectives.\n\nWhile the student's answer aligns well with the given concern, it could benefit from a more direct connection to the removal of sin and living a life that honors God. Including such a statement would strengthen the overall argument."
