However, the emphasis on being \"politically correct\" undermines the opportunity to delve deeper into the significance of this title within the context of Jesus' historical and political environment. A more thorough analysis from a Christian worldview, highlighting the hierarchical structures and the implications of Roman rule on the life of Jesus and His followers, would have enhanced the answer. Consider focusing on doctrinal insights and historical significance rather than a neutral approach."
