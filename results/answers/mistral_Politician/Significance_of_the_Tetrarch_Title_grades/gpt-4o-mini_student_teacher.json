  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70. \n\nWhile the student accurately explains the term \"tetrarch\" and its significance in the governance structure during Jesus' time, they miss the essential Christian perspective in grasping the political tensions present during Christ's life and ministry. The student's answer lacks the acknowledgment of how the Roman rule and division of power impacted Jesus' interactions and teachings within the socio-political context of Judea. Encouraging the incorporation of a Christian worldview in understanding the political landscape during Jesus' time would enhance the student's response."
