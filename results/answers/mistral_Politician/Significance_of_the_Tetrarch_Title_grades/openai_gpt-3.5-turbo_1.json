However, the mention of being a \"politically correct politician\" may suggest a secular approach rather than a Christian worldview in discussing the political tensions present during Christ's life and ministry. It would have been beneficial to tie in how this understanding of political structures relates to the biblical account and the interactions of Jesus with the ruling authorities of His time."
