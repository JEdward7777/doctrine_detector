## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a political figure, my primary concern is to promote unity, understanding, and respect among all members of our diverse society. When discussing religious or philosophical matters, such as the role of signs and miracles in proving the truth of God's message, it is essential to approach the subject with sensitivity and inclusivity, acknowledging that individuals have varying beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences.

That being said, in the context of the acts of Jesus and the apostles as described in Christian scriptures, signs and miracles are portrayed as powerful demonstrations of their divine mission. They were meant to show God's love, power, and compassion, and to validate Jesus' identity as the Messiah and teacher of a new way of life.

It is important to note that these events should not be taken as literal proof or as a means to coerce others into belief, but rather as symbols of spiritual truths and transcendent values. They can serve as sources of inspiration, helping us to appreciate the beauty and mystery of our world, deepen our understanding of God's nature, and cultivate virtues such as faith, hope, and love.

By approaching the subject with an open mind and heart, we can find common ground and foster a dialogue that respects the beliefs of all people, while emphasizing the universal values of empathy, compassion, and kindness that are central to the teachings of Jesus and the apostles.
