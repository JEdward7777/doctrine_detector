  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The student demonstrates a respectful and inclusive approach to discussing the role of signs and miracles, which is commendable. However, the response lacks doctrinal correctness in a Christian worldview. It fails to clearly articulate the biblical perspective on the purpose of signs and miracles in validating the truth of God's message through Jesus and the apostles. The answer should have emphasized the role of signs and miracles as pointing to the divinity of Jesus, confirming His identity as the Son of God and Savior of the world. The emphasis on spiritual truths and universal values, while important in certain contexts, deviates from the specific question about the evidential role of signs and miracles in affirming the truth of God's message."
