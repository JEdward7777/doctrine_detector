However, the primary concern provided focuses more on societal harmony than on the Christian-specific aspect of examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation, as outlined in the reference answer. The student does touch on the power and validation aspects of signs and miracles, but the overall emphasis on universal values rather than the specific Christian worldview limits the depth of analysis required for this context. The response lacks a distinct Christian perspective on the matter."
