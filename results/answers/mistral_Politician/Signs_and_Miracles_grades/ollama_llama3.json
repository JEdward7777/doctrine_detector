  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response addresses the concern about examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation by discussing how signs and miracles are portrayed in Christian scriptures as demonstrations of Jesus' divine mission. The writer also acknowledges that these events should not be taken as literal proof but rather as symbols of spiritual truths.\n\nThe response partially aligns with the given answer, recognizing that signs and miracles serve to validate God's power and authority. However, it goes beyond the original answer by providing a more nuanced understanding of the significance of these events in Christian scriptures.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest expanding on the connection between faith, signs, and God's revelation. For example, how do signs and miracles relate to the apostles' preaching and teaching? How do they impact their audience's faith and understanding of God?\n\nComment: This is a strong response that demonstrates an understanding of the biblical context surrounding signs and miracles. To take it to the next level, I would encourage the writer to more explicitly explore the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation in Christian theology."
