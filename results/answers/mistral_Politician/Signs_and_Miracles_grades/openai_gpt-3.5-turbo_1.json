It also acknowledges the importance of approaching the subject with sensitivity and inclusivity, reflecting the Christian value of empathy and respect for diverse beliefs. The only area for improvement could be to provide a more explicit tie-in between faith, signs, and God's revelation to further strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
