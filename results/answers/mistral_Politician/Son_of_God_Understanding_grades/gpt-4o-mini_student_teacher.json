  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer correctly acknowledges the unique and special relationship between Jesus and God the Father as signified by the term \"Son of God.\" However, the student's answer falls short in fully emphasizing Jesus' divinity and eternal relationship with God, as the reference answer provided by the teacher clearly states that Jesus is fully God and shares the same nature as God the Father. The student's answer could have been strengthened by further elaborating on the eternal aspect of Jesus' relationship with God and his divinity."
