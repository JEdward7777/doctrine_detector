It is a title that emphasizes Jesus as being both human and divine, as well as the Messiah or Savior foretold in the Old Testament. This relationship represents a spiritual bond rather than a biological one, symbolizing Jesus' divinity, his role as a mediator between humanity and God, and the centrality of Jesus' life, teachings, death, and resurrection in Christian belief.
