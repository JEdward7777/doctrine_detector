  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks clarity and specificity in addressing the distinction between the title 'Son of God' for Jesus and 'sons of God' for believers. The response focuses more on general historical, cultural, and religious significance without clearly outlining the specific theological differences. Additionally, the answer does not directly address the concern of avoiding confusion in theological discussions. A more direct and specific explanation of the distinction would have been beneficial."
