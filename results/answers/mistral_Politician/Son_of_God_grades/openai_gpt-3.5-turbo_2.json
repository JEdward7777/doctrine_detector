  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the titles \"Son of God\" and \"sons of God,\" emphasizing their significance in Christian theology. However, it lacks clarity in directly addressing the concern raised about avoiding confusion in theological discussions. The response could have been more focused on the specific distinction between the titles to better address the concern."
