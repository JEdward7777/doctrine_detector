  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response does a good job of explaining the distinction between the specific title \"Son of God\" and the broader term \"sons of God\" based on the given answer. However, the concern is not fully addressed as the initial response lacks a clear and direct distinction between the two titles. It could have been enhanced by directly stating the potential for confusion in theological discussions when the titles are not properly understood. Additionally, the response could have emphasized more on the importance of accurately representing these concepts in Christian theology to avoid misunderstandings."
