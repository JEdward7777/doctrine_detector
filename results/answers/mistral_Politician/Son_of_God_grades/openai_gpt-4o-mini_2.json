  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" and \"sons of God\" based on Christian theology. The candidate correctly explains the specific significance of the titles in Christianity. The only concern is that the response could have been more direct and clear in articulating the distinction to avoid confusion in theological discussions as mentioned."
