However, it lacks depth and fails to engage critically with the doctrinal implications of these interpretations from a Christian worldview. There is a tendency to present all perspectives as equally valid without clearly indicating which interpretation aligns best with orthodox Christian beliefs. More analysis and clarity on the theological implications of each interpretation would have strengthened the response."
