  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-rounded explanation of the different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" as seen in the Bible, particularly in Genesis 6. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents various viewpoints with respect and clarity. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the biblical and theological implications of each interpretation from a Christian worldview. Additionally, while the student encouraged open dialogue and understanding, a more distinct alignment with a Christian-specific interpretation could have been beneficial in this context."
