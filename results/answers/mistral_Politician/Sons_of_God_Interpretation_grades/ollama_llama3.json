  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by acknowledging that there are different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6. However, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the various interpretations, nor does it engage with the issue of biblical interpretation itself. The answer is brief and lacks depth, which prevents it from fully addressing the concern.\n\nThe response mentions three possible interpretations of the term \"sons of God\", but these are not elaborated upon or supported by biblical evidence. Additionally, the answer does not explicitly state that understanding biblical interpretation helps in grasping the meaning of scripture passages, which is a key aspect of the concern.\n\nOverall, while the response touches on the issue of biblical interpretation and offers some possible interpretations of the term \"sons of God\", it could be improved by providing more detail, evidence, and engagement with the topic."
