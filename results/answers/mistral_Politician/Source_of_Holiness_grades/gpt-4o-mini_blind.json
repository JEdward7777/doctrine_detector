The focus on personal holiness and living according to the teachings of Jesus Christ is commendable. However, the answer could have been strengthened by including references to scriptural support for the concept of saints and emphasizing the role of grace in the sanctification process. Additionally, while sensitivity to differing denominational beliefs is important, a clearer distinction between Catholic beliefs on sainthood and those of other Christian traditions could have been beneficial."
