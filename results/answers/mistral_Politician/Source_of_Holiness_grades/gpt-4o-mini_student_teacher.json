  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the process of canonization within the Catholic tradition and emphasizes personal holiness through faith, prayer, and good works. However, the answer fails to explicitly address the central role of faith in Jesus in becoming saints according to the Christian faith, as highlighted in the reference answer. It is important to clarify that believers become saints not solely through their own actions, but ultimately through their faith in Jesus Christ. The student's response could be strengthened by clearly connecting the source of holiness to faith in Jesus."
