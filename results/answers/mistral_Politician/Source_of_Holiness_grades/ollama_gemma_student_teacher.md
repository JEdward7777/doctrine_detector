## Question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)

Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In Christianity, the concept of "sainthood" is not about becoming one in a political or worldly sense but rather a spiritual recognition of extraordinary holiness and closeness to God, often earned through a life of love, service, and devotion. The process of canonization, which is how the Catholic Church officially declares someone a saint, involves several steps including verification of a candidate's heroic virtue, proof of a miraculous intervention after their death, and confirmation by the Pope.

It's important to note that this process can take centuries, and not every believer aspires or achieves sainthood. Instead, many Christians strive for personal holiness through faith, prayer, good works, and living according to the teachings of Jesus Christ in their daily lives. The ultimate goal is to live a life pleasing to God and attain eternal life in heaven.

By emphasizing this spiritual journey towards holiness, we can avoid potential misinterpretations or offenses that might arise from discussing the specific process of canonization. It's also crucial to remember that Christian faith is deeply personal and varies among different denominations, so it's essential to approach these discussions with sensitivity and respect for individual beliefs.
