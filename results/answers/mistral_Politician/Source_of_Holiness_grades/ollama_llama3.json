It also correctly notes that the process of canonization involves verifying heroic virtue, miraculous interventions, and papal confirmation. However, while it mentions the importance of faith in Jesus Christ, it does not explicitly state that believers become saints solely because of their faith in his saving work. To fully reinforce the central role of faith in Jesus Christ, the response could have more directly linked the concept of sainthood to believers' faith in Christ's redemptive work.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by highlighting the spiritual nature of sainthood and the importance of faith in Jesus Christ. However, it could be improved by further emphasizing how faith in Jesus makes believers holy, as stated in the given answer."
