  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively clarifies the source of holiness in Christianity, emphasizing that believers become saints through their faith in Jesus Christ's saving work rather than their own deeds. This aligns well with the concern provided, reinforcing the central role of faith in Jesus in Christian doctrine. The response also provides a clear understanding of the spiritual journey towards holiness and the process of canonization, showing respect for individual beliefs and encouraging sensitivity in discussions on sainthood."
