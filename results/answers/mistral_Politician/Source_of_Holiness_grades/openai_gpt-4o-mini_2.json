It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting that believers become saints through faith in Jesus Christ's saving work, not their own deeds. The response also underscores the importance of a personal spiritual journey towards holiness rather than mere external recognition. It aligns well with Christian doctrine by emphasizing the source of holiness in Jesus Christ."
