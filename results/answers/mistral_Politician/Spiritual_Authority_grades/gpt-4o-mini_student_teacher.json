  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive comparison between spiritual and earthly authorities but fails to explicitly emphasize the ultimate authority of God in spiritual matters as the reference answer does. The response also lacks a clear delineation of the implications for a Christian's life in understanding these distinctions. The student's approach to catering to diverse beliefs is commendable, but the focus should have been on presenting a distinctly Christian worldview on the topic."
