The reference to Ephesians 6:12 effectively highlights the spiritual realm's influence over individuals who do not submit to God's authority, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and adhering to spiritual authority in a Christian's life. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the significance of understanding and discerning the implications of both spiritual and worldly authorities within a Christian framework."
