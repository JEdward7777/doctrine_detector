It correctly highlights the association between demons and idols in leading people away from the worship of the one true God. The reference to Leviticus 17:7 supports the explanation well. However, the response could be enhanced by including additional relevant biblical passages that highlight the connection between demons and idolatry, as well as by expanding on how believers can guard themselves against such deception through reliance on God's Word and spiritual discernment."
