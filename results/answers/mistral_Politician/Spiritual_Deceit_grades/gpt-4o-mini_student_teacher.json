  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a solid understanding of how demons are believed to deceive individuals into idolatry according to biblical perspective. They reference relevant scripture and convey the concept of deception and temptation well. However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly stating the truth that only Yahweh is God, as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a good understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
