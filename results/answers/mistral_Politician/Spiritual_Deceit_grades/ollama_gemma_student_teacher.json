  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical perspective on the role of demons in the deception of idolatry. They accurately cite relevant scripture and provide a concise explanation of the belief that idols are vessels for demonic influence. The response is well-written and demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the topic. However, the grade could be improved by expanding on the specific mechanisms by which demons are believed to deceive people into idolatry."
