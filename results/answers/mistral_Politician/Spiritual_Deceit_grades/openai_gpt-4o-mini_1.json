The reference to Leviticus 17:7 supports the argument well. It addresses the concern of spiritual deceit and emphasizes the importance for Christians to remain vigilant against influences that lead them away from the truth of God's sovereignty. Overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on demons and idolatry."
