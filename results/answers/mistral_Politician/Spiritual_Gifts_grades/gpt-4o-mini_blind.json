The response fails to emphasize the source of spiritual gifts being the Holy Spirit and downplays the supernatural aspect of these gifts. It also places too much emphasis on political correctness and diversity, rather than focusing on the biblical teachings concerning spiritual gifts. Encouragement to respect differing beliefs is valid, but it should not overshadow the foundational truths of the Christian faith when discussing spiritual gifts."
