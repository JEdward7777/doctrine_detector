  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of spiritual gifts as described in the Bible, acknowledging the varied interpretations that exist. However, the response lacked a clear emphasis on the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit, which was the specified concern. The student also focused more on political correctness and diversity rather than emphasizing the core Christian perspective on spiritual gifts. There is room for improvement in aligning the answer more closely with the Christian worldview and the reference answer provided by the teacher."
