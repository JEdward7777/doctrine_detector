However, it falls short in addressing the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. The focus on political correctness and respecting diverse beliefs undermines the significance of actively applying spiritual gifts for serving others and building up the church. Encouraging the practical application of spiritual gifts in alignment with biblical teachings would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
