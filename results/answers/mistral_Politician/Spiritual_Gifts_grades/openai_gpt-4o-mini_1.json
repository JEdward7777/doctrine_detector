It acknowledges the existence of spiritual gifts and their purpose for building up the church and serving others. However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on the importance of utilizing these spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit, as outlined in the specified concern. Additionally, while respecting diverse beliefs is important, from a Christian perspective, there is value in emphasizing the biblical understanding of spiritual gifts as essential for the edification of the body of Christ. The response could have been improved by highlighting the significance of discerning and stewarding one's spiritual gifts in alignment with God's plan for community growth and personal obedience."
