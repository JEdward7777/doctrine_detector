  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response touches on the importance of openness, honesty, and mutual support in spiritual healing, it lacks a clear articulation of the biblical foundation of confessing sins to one another as mentioned in James 5:16. The student could improve the grade by incorporating more direct references to the Bible and explicating how confessing sins to one another aligns with Christian beliefs on repentance, forgiveness, and accountability. The focus should be on the biblical perspective rather than a political or societal lens."
