## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In a Christian context, "circumcision of the heart" symbolizes spiritual purity or a change of heart that goes beyond outward ritual observance. It originates from Deuteronomy 10:16 and 30:6, where God instructs the Israelites to circumcise their hearts and not just follow physical laws. This is often interpreted as following God's commandments with sincere intent rather than just out of tradition or obligation. In Christianity, it is seen as a metaphor for spiritual transformation, repentance, and obedience to God. It does not refer to any physical procedure.
