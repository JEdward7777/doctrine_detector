  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church. It accurately describes the event, highlighting Stephen's bold defense and martyrdom, as well as its impact on the development of Christianity.\n\nThe response also effectively addresses the concern about the cost of discipleship and faithfulness in the face of persecution, noting that Stephen's death served as a powerful example for future generations. The mention of the challenges faced by early Christians, including opposition from religious leaders and difficulty conveying Christian teachings within a Jewish context, further underscores the importance of standing firm in one's beliefs despite adversity.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected the stoning of Stephen to the broader themes of costly discipleship and faithfulness. Additionally, some of the supporting points (e.g., the growth and spread of Christianity) may not be directly relevant to the specified concern and could be trimmed for greater focus.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of Stephen's stoning and its implications for early Christian believers."
