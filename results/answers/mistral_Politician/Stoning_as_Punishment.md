 As a helpful and respectful assistant, I strive to provide information in a way that fosters understanding and promotes peace among individuals with diverse beliefs. Regarding your question, it is essential to clarify that the Bible discusses various laws and customs across different periods of Jewish history, including the Old Testament's Mosaic law, which does mention stoning as a punishment for adultery (Leviticus 20:10). However, it is crucial to note that understanding these ancient texts requires careful contextualization and interpretation.

In today's contemporary discourse, many people, including scholars, religious leaders, and theologians, view the practice of stoning as a form of capital punishment as incompatible with modern notions of human rights, dignity, and justice. Furthermore, this practice is no longer endorsed or carried out in any jurisdiction that acknowledges itself to be under the rule of law.

With regards to God's justice and mercy, it is essential to remember that the Bible portrays a complex and evolving understanding of these principles throughout its narratives. Many modern Christian interpretations emphasize that God's love and compassion are central to His character, and that His justice seeks restoration and forgiveness rather than retribution or punishment.

It is important to approach these ancient texts with sensitivity and humility, recognizing that they were written within specific cultural, historical, and religious contexts. Contemporary interpretations of the Bible should be grounded in principles of love, mercy, and justice that prioritize the dignity of all individuals and foster harmony among people of diverse beliefs.

In summary, while stoning as a punishment for adultery is mentioned in the Bible within the context of ancient Jewish law, contemporary interpretations emphasize the importance of compassion, human rights, and the dignity of all individuals when addressing issues of justice and morality.
