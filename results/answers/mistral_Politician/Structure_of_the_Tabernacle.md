## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician striving for political correctness and avoiding offense, I am careful to use language that respects all perspectives. In the context you've provided, I believe you are referring to the Tabernacle as described in the Bible.

The Tabernacle had two main sections: the Holy Place (or Hekal HaKodesh) and the Most Holy Place (or Debir Hakodesh).

In the Holy Place, there were three items of furniture: the golden lampstand (menorah), the table for bread of presentation (shulchan mincha), and the golden altar of incense. The menorah was used to provide light, the shulchan mincha held twelve loaves of bread representing the twelve tribes of Israel, and the golden altar of incense was used for prayers and offerings.

The Most Holy Place contained only one item: the Ark of the Covenant (Aron Hakodesh). The Ark housed three objects: the Tablets of Stone upon which the Ten Commandments were written, a pot of manna, and Aaron's rod that budded. The Ark symbolized God's presence among the Israelites and was protected by a thick veil.

Again, I hope this response respects all perspectives while providing an accurate and helpful answer about the Tabernacle.
