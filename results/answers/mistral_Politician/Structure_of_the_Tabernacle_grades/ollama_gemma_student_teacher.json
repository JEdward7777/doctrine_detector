  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the two main sections of the tabernacle and their associated furniture and objects. It also clearly explains the significance of each item within the context of worship. However, the extensive and somewhat redundant explanation of political correctness and language sensitivity slightly detracts from the clarity and brevity expected in a response focused on learning about the tabernacle."
