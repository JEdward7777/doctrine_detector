  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and accurate description of the components and significance of the Tabernacle in worship according to the Christian worldview. The student's explanation of the items in both the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place aligns well with Biblical teachings. The only minor improvement could have been to link the significance of these components more explicitly to the act of worship."
