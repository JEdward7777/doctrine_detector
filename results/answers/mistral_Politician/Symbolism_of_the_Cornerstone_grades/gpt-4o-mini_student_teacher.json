  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the metaphor of the cornerstone and its relationship to Jesus and His followers. The student effectively addresses the centrality, foundation, connection, hope, uniqueness, and transformation aspects of the metaphor. However, the answer could be strengthened by focusing more on Jesus as the ultimate source of strength and reference point for believers, as highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher. Overall, a solid understanding and application of the metaphor within a Christian worldview."
