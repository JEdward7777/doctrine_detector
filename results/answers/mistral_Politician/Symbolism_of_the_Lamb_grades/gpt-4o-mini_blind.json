However, it falls short in providing a solid doctrinal explanation from a Christian perspective. The response lacks depth in explaining how the sacrificial system of the Old Testament foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the \"Lamb of God\" in the New Testament. Additionally, the importance of shedding blood for the forgiveness of sins as stated in Hebrews 9:22 is not addressed. The answer could benefit from a clearer connection between the sacrificial system in the Old Testament and the fulfillment of atonement in the New Testament through Jesus Christ."
