They demonstrate a good understanding of the symbolism and cultural context surrounding this practice. However, the answer could have been strengthened by directly linking the symbolism of innocence and purity of the lamb to the concept of atonement as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, a more explicit Christian perspective could have been integrated to further enhance the response."
