It acknowledges the importance of the concept of substitutionary atonement and the significance of the practice in Jewish religious traditions. The integration of empathy and respect in discussions about this topic is commendable. However, the response could have further emphasized the Christian perspective on how Jesus Christ, as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb, fulfills and transcends the Old Testament sacrificial system, providing redemption for all humanity."
