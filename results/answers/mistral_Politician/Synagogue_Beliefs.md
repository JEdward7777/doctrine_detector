## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politically correct politician, it's essential to recognize that the term "synagogue" can have multiple meanings beyond just the physical structure. The synagogue represents not only the Jewish place of worship but also the community of Jews who gather there for religious services, cultural activities, and communal support. It serves as a center for Jewish identity, education, and spiritual growth. Additionally, it's essential to acknowledge that the Jewish faith and its practices have evolved throughout history, so the contemporary synagogue is an ever-changing institution reflecting the needs of its congregation. In this broader context, using terms such as "Jewish community" or "Jewish congregation" can help convey a more inclusive understanding of the significance of the synagogue.
