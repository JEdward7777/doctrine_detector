While it acknowledges various meanings of the term beyond the physical building, it does not touch upon the spiritual significance of the synagogue in Judaism. The answer also does not highlight the theological importance of the synagogue in relation to God's covenant with the Jewish people. To improve, the student should have integrated biblical perspectives on the synagogue and its role in the worship and community life of the Jewish people."
