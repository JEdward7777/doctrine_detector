However, the response seems to focus more on the evolution and modern interpretation of the synagogue, rather than directly addressing the communal significance of gathering for worship. The student could have further emphasized the importance of the congregation coming together for worship and spiritual growth in understanding the term 'synagogue' beyond just the physical building."
