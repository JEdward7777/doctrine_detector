While it mentions key points about the physical temple in the Old Testament and the shift to individual and internal dwelling in the New Testament, there is a lack of depth in theological analysis. The answer could have delved deeper into the theological significance of the temple as God's dwelling in both contexts, including themes of sacrifice, atonement, and redemption. Furthermore, the mention of \"neutral entity\" and the invitation for diverse perspectives may inadvertently downplay the uniqueness and exclusivity of Christian beliefs."
