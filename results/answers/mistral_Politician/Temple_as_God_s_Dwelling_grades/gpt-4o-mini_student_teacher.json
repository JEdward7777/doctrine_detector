  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and accurate analysis of how the concept of the temple as God's dwelling is expressed in both the Old and New Testaments. They discuss the significance of the physical temple in Jerusalem in the Old Testament and the shift to believers being temples of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. The student effectively explores the theological implications of God dwelling among His people. However, their approach lacks a strong Christian worldview perspective, and they miss emphasizing the personal relationship aspect of believers being temples of the Holy Spirit, which is central to Christian theology."
