The answer accurately summarizes the key points and transitions smoothly between the Old and New Testament perspectives. The integration of relevant biblical references strengthens the argument, and the conclusion ties everything together well. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on how the shift from the physical temple to believers as temples of the Holy Spirit impacts Christian theology and practice."
