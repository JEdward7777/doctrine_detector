  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid academic analysis of how the concept of God's dwelling is presented in both the Old and New Testaments, acknowledging the shift from the physical temple in Jerusalem to believers being referred to as the 'temple of the Holy Spirit'. The theological implications of God dwelling among His people are effectively explored, drawing from relevant biblical passages and demonstrating an understanding of the Christian worldview. The response could be improved by delving deeper into the significance of this shift and how it shapes the relationship between God and His people in a more detailed theological analysis."
