It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the theological implications of God dwelling among His people, emphasizing the shift from a physical temple in the Old Testament to believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. The response could further strengthen the Christian worldview perspective by emphasizing the significance of Christ's sacrifice and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers as a means of God's presence among His people in the New Testament."
