## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the biblical account found in Matthew 4:1-11, Jesus resisted Satan's temptations through a combination of steadfast faith, reliance on scripture, and an unwavering commitment to God's will.

When Satan tempted Jesus to turn stones into bread, Jesus replied, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." (Matthew 4:4)

Next, Satan took Jesus to the Holy City and urged him to throw himself down from the temple's pinnacle, trusting that angels would save him. But Jesus answered, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." (Matthew 4:7)

Finally, Satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world if he would bow down and worship him. Jesus responded by quoting Scripture: "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve." (Matthew 4:10)

By resisting Satan's temptations in this manner, Jesus demonstrated a commitment to God's will above all else, setting an example for humanity to follow. It is important to remember that the focus should always be on promoting love, understanding, and respect for all people, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds.
