  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly answers the prompt by providing specific biblical references to illustrate Jesus' resistance to temptation. The writer effectively breaks down each of Satan's temptations and shows how Jesus responded, highlighting Jesus' commitment to God's will and steadfast faith. The conclusion is also well-structured, emphasizing the importance of following Jesus' example in spiritual battles.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more explicit in drawing out the implications for Christian living. While it does mention setting an example for humanity to follow, it could go further in exploring how Christians can apply this model to their own lives and struggles.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical account and effectively applies its lessons to the concern about providing a model for Christian spiritual battles."
