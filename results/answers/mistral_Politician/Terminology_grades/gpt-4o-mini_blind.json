However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note that a deacon holds a specific and significant role within the church structure, ordained for service and ministry. While the alternatives offered are thoughtful, they do not fully capture the ordained nature and specific responsibilities of a deacon as outlined in Christian doctrine. The response could be improved by including terms that reflect the biblical and doctrinal aspects of the deacon's role in the church."
