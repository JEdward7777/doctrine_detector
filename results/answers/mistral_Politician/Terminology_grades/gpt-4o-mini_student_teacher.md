Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided thoughtful alternative terms that reflect the individual's role within the church. While the terms mentioned are creative and descriptive, they may not directly align with the traditional or commonly used terms to describe a deacon within a Christian worldview. Encouraging the student to consider terms that are more widely recognized and commonly used within Christian denominations when discussing service roles in the church would enhance the response.
