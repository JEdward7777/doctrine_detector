However, it could be improved by more explicitly acknowledging the concern of recognizing the diverse roles and responsibilities within the church. For example, the response could have started with a statement like \"A deacon's role can be described in various ways...\" to directly address the concern.\n\nThe given options (1-6) do a good job of highlighting different aspects of a deacon's service, such as their faith-based role, leadership position, and spiritual guidance. Option 5, specifically, effectively bridges the gap between describing a deacon's role and recognizing its similarity to other church administrative positions."
