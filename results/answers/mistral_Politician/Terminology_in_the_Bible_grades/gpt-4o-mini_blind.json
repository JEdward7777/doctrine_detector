  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a deep understanding of the terms used interchangeably to refer to God's chosen people in the Bible. The student effectively explains the nuances between Jews, Israelites, and Hebrews, providing biblical references for clarification. The response is well-researched, detailed, and presents the information in a clear and coherent manner. The only improvement could be to include a scriptural reference for the term \"Hebrew\" when it is used in a broader context to refer to people living in or around ancient Canaan. Overall, an excellent response."
