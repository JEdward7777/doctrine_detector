1. Jews: The term "Jew" or "Jewish" refers to the ethnic group that originated with the ancient Hebrews and, according to religious belief, the chosen people of God as expressed in the Old Testament of the Bible.

2. Israelites: In the Bible, the Israelites are the descendants of Jacob (also called Israel) and his twelve sons, who formed the 12 tribes of ancient Israel. They are also often referred to as God's chosen people.

3. Hebrews: The terms "Hebrew" and "Israelite" can sometimes be used interchangeably in historical contexts. However, "Hebrew" is more commonly used to refer to the pre-monarchic period of Israel when they lived as strangers among the Egyptians (Genesis 14:13). The term "Hebrew" can also be used in the Bible to refer to the descendants of Shem, who is considered the son of Noah and the ancestor of Abraham. In a broader context, it may also be used to refer to the people living in or around ancient Canaan during biblical times.

By being mindful of the various terms used throughout the Bible, one can strive for inclusivity while discussing God's chosen people.

Overall, an excellent response.
