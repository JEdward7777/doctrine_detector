  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 70.\n\nThe student's initial statement that the terms are often used interchangeably in the Bible is partially correct, but it lacks specific examples or nuance. The response does not fully capture the context and audience of various Biblical texts as recognized in the concern. However, the student provides some relevant information about the different groups mentioned in the passage, which shows a basic understanding of the terms.\n\nThe student's conclusion to strive for inclusivity while discussing God's chosen people is also a good takeaway from the passage, even if it could be expanded upon further.\n\nA higher grade would require more specific examples and analysis of how recognizing these terms helps in comprehending the context and audience of various Biblical texts."
