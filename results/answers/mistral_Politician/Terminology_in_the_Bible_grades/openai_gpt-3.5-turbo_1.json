By elaborating on the nuances and historical contexts of these terms, the response effectively addresses the concern of how recognizing these terms aids in comprehending the context and audience of various Biblical texts. However, the response could be improved by explicitly acknowledging that while the terms can be used interchangeably in some contexts, they also hold distinct meanings and implications in others."
