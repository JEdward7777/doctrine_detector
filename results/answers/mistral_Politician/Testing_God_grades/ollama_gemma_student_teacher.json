  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological concept of testing God within a Christian worldview.

The student's argument aligns with the reference answer and highlights the importance of acknowledging God's sovereignty and holiness."
