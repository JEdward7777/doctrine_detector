  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe response generally aligns with the concern of recognizing the principle that it's wrong to put God to the test, which involves taking advantage of His mercy and goes against acknowledging Him as the almighty and holy God. The writer correctly identifies the root of the issue in the religious context of the Ten Commandments and provides a clear explanation of what testing God implies.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement. While the response does touch on the importance of respecting others' values and beliefs, it could have delved deeper into the theological implications of this principle. Additionally, some sentences could be rephrased for greater clarity and cohesion.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the issue and its biblical basis, but could benefit from further development and refinement to fully address the concern."
