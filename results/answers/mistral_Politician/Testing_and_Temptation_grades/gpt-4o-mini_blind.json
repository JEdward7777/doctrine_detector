  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: While the student attempted to provide a diplomatic and inclusive response, they missed the mark in addressing the question from a biblical perspective. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to delve into the theological distinctions between testing and temptation in a biblical context. Additionally, the emphasis on promoting unity and understanding, while admirable, detracts from the necessary focus on providing a clear explanation rooted in Christian beliefs. A stronger connection to biblical teachings and principles would have enhanced the response."
