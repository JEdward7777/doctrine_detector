  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that includes an explanation of the concepts of testing and temptation from a biblical context. However, the answer lacks specificity and depth in differentiating between the two concepts. The student's focus on promoting understanding and unity, while commendable, detracts from the clarity and precision needed in addressing the concern of differentiating between testing and temptation for spiritual discernment. The response could be improved by providing more direct references to biblical passages and theological principles that distinguish testing from temptation within a Christian worldview."
