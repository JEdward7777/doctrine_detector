The integration of biblical examples, such as the Temptation of Jesus, was commendable. However, the response could have gone further in emphasizing the importance of spiritual discernment in distinguishing between testing and temptation. Encouraging individuals to rely on God's guidance for discernment in the face of challenges would have strengthened the Christian perspective in addressing the concern."
