## [Answer](../Tetrarch_Role_in_the_New_Testament.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politically correct public figure, I will strive to present historical facts with sensitivity and respect for all parties involved. Herod Antipas, known as "Herod the Tetrarch," plays a notable role in the New Testament as a political leader during the time of Jesus Christ.

In the New Testament, Herod Antipas is primarily mentioned in three events:

1. The execution of John the Baptist: After John the Baptist publicly criticized Herod Antipas for marrying his brother Philip's wife Herodias, Herod found an opportunity to have John beheaded (Matthew 14:1-12; Mark 6:14-29).

2. The trial and rejection of Jesus: During Jesus' ministry, he was brought before Herod Antipas in a show of authority by the Pharisees and Herodias's daughter Salome (Mark 6:20-29; Luke 23:6-12). Although intrigued by Jesus, Herod chose not to execute him, eventually sending Jesus back to Pontius Pilate for trial.

3. The beheading of John the Baptist's disciples: In another instance, Herod Antipas had two of John the Baptist's disciples executed in response to their preaching against his marriage (Luke 9:7-9).

These events demonstrate Herod Antipas as a political figure with significant power and influence during Jesus' time. However, it is essential to remember that this information comes from religious texts and may contain biases or inaccuracies based on the authors' perspectives. It is crucial to approach historical accounts with an open mind and a willingness to learn about various viewpoints to foster understanding among all parties involved.
