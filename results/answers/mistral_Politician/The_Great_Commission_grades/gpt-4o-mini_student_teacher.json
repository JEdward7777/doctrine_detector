  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a strong answer that correctly identifies the command Jesus gave to His disciples before ascending to heaven, which aligns with the reference answer. The student also effectively connects the command to the broader context of the Great Commission, emphasizing the importance of sharing the message of salvation. The reference to not focusing on political correctness but rather on sharing the saving grace of Jesus Christ demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian worldview in relation to discipleship. The only minor improvement could be a more concise and direct presentation of the answer without unnecessary elaborations."
