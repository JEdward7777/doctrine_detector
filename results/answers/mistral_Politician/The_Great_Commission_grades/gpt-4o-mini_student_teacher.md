## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 The command given by Jesus to His disciples before His ascension into heaven, as recorded in the Bible (Matthew 28:19-20), was not about being politically correct, but rather about sharing the good news of salvation. He said, "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you." This command is often referred to as the Great Commission. It is a call for believers to share the message of faith with others, not to offend or please people, but to bring them the saving grace of Jesus Christ.

Comment: The student provided a strong answer that correctly identifies the command Jesus gave to His disciples before ascending to heaven, which aligns with the reference answer. The student also effectively connects the command to the broader context of the Great Commission, emphasizing the importance of sharing the message of salvation. The reference to not focusing on political correctness but rather on sharing the saving grace of Jesus Christ demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian worldview in relation to discipleship. The only minor improvement could be a more concise and direct presentation of the answer without unnecessary elaborations.
