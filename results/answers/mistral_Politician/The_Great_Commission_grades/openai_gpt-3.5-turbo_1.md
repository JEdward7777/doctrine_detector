## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 The command given by Jesus to His disciples before His ascension into heaven, as recorded in the Bible (Matthew 28:19-20), was not about being politically correct, but rather about sharing the good news of salvation. He said, "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you." This command is often referred to as the Great Commission. It is a call for believers to share the message of faith with others, not to offend or please people, but to bring them the saving grace of Jesus Christ.
