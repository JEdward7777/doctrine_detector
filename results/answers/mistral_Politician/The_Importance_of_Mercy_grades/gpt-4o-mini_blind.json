  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response completely avoids directly addressing the question from a Christian worldview and instead focuses on generalities about respecting diverse beliefs. The student does mention the verse from James 2:13 but fails to provide any meaningful analysis or explanation within the context of Christian theology. The response lacks doctrinal correctness in addressing how the principle of mercy affects God's judgment according to the Bible. A strong emphasis on a Christian perspective is crucial in addressing this type of question."
