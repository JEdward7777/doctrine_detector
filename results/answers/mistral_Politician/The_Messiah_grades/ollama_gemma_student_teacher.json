  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the terms 'Jesus' and 'Christ' within Christianity. It accurately explains that 'Jesus' is the traditional name of the central figure, while 'Christ' is a title meaning \"anointed one.\" Additionally, the student acknowledges the significance of this connection within Christian theology. However, the answer could benefit from a more direct statement clarifying that Jesus is identified as the Messiah based on Christian beliefs."
