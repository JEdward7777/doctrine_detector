The connection to Jesus being recognized as God's Son and the Messiah is well articulated, addressing the concern raised. However, the response could further emphasize the implications of Jesus being identified as the Messiah in terms of salvation and fulfillment of messianic prophecies within Christian theology for a more comprehensive understanding."
