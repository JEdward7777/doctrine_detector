  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response lacks a clear Christian worldview perspective on prayer and addressing the concern about distinguishing prayer from false practices. They focus more on inclusivity and respect for diverse beliefs without offering a concrete distinction between praying to the true God and false gods from a Christian standpoint. The response could be improved by emphasizing the importance of a genuine relationship with God in prayer and the biblical teachings on avoiding worshiping false gods."
