  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a thoughtful analysis on the distinction between praying to God versus a false god, emphasizing the importance of spiritual communion and relationship with the divine. The candidate's response was well-reasoned and aligned with Christian teachings on prayer and worship. However, one small area for improvement could be providing more specific examples or references to Christian scripture to bolster the argument further."
