  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that demonstrates a clear understanding of the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant. They effectively connected the concept of God writing His law on the people's hearts with a transformative relationship, internalization of His laws, and the role of the Holy Spirit in enabling believers to live according to God's will. The student's answer effectively addresses the concern raised and aligns well with a Christian worldview."
