They reference relevant Bible verses and discuss the spiritual transformation believers undergo to be conformed to Christ's likeness. However, the student's answer could be more concise and focused on the specific aspect of believers being transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection and sharing in His eternal glory, as highlighted in the reference answer."
