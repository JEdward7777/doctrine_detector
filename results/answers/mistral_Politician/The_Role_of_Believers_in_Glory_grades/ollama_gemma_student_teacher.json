  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of believers being glorified with Christ according to the New Testament. \n\nThe student clearly explains that glorification is not about personal accolades but rather about being made holy and perfect in God's eyes through faith in Jesus. The student also provides relevant scriptures to support their claims.\n\nHowever, the answer could be improved by elaborating on the idea of transformation being a gradual process rather than an instantaneous event. Additionally, the student could have elaborated on the significance of believers sharing in Christ's eternal glory.\n\nOverall, this is a well-written and informative answer that demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject matter."
