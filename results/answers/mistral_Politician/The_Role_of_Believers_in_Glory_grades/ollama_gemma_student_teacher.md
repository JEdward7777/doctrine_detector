## [Answer](../The_Role_of_Believers_in_Glory.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the context of the New Testament, the concept of believers being "glorified with Christ" refers to a state of perfect righteousness, sanctification, and eternal life that comes from a spiritual union with Jesus Christ. This glorification is not about personal accolades or recognition, but rather about being made holy and perfect in God's eyes through faith in Jesus.

In John 17:22, Jesus prays to the Father saying, "The glory that you have given me I have given them, so that they may be one, as we are one." Here, Jesus is speaking about the unity and holiness that believers will share with Him. In 2 Corinthians 3:18, it says, "And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit." This verse emphasizes that believers will be changed more and more to resemble Christ as they gaze upon Him.

In essence, believers are "glorified with Christ" when they are conformed to His likeness, share in His perfection, and are granted eternal life with Him through faith. It's important to note that this is a spiritual transformation that occurs over time and is the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer.
