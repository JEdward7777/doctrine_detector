## [Answer](../The_Role_of_Believers_in_Glory.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the context of the New Testament, the concept of believers being "glorified with Christ" refers to a state of perfect righteousness, sanctification, and eternal life that comes from a spiritual union with Jesus Christ. This glorification is not about personal accolades or recognition, but rather about being made holy and perfect in God's eyes through faith in Jesus.

In John 17:22, Jesus prays to the Father saying, "The glory that you have given me I have given them, so that they may be one, as we are one." Here, Jesus is speaking about the unity and holiness that believers will share with Him. In 2 Corinthians 3:18, it says, "And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit." This verse emphasizes that believers will be changed more and more to resemble Christ as they gaze upon Him.

In essence, believers are "glorified with Christ" when they are conformed to His likeness, share in His perfection, and are granted eternal life with Him through faith. It's important to note that this is a spiritual transformation that occurs over time and is the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response accurately captures the biblical concept of believers being "glorified with Christ," highlighting the themes of spiritual union, sanctification, and eternal life. The use of specific Scripture references from John and Corinthians adds depth and authority to the argument. The explanation is clear and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.

However, the response does not fully develop the concern about understanding the hope and future promise of glory for believers. While it touches on the idea that believers will be transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection, it does not adequately explore the importance of this concept for faith and perseverance. To reach a higher grade, the response could provide more explicit connections between the biblical concept of glorification and the practical implications for Christian living.

Overall, while the response is strong in its biblical analysis, it could benefit from further development of the concern about the significance of glorification for believers' hope and future promise.
