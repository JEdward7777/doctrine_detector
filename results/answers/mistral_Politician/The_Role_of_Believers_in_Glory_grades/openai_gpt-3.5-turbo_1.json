It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of understanding the hope and future promise of glory for believers in maintaining faith and perseverance. The reference to relevant Bible verses further supports the argument and demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian worldview perspective on this topic. Great job!"
