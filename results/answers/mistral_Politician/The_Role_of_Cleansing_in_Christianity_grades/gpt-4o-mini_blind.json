  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has shown a good understanding of the concept of cleansing in the Bible and its connection to New Testament teachings about sin and redemption. They accurately highlighted the shift from external rituals for purification in the Old Testament to inner purification through faith in Christ in the New Testament. However, the response could be improved by explicitly mentioning the significance of Jesus' sacrificial death as the ultimate cleansing for sin in line with Christian doctrine. Additionally, they could have emphasized the role of repentance and the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in the process of cleansing and redemption."
