 As a political figure, I must emphasize that I am not a theologian, but I can share my understanding based on general knowledge and common interpretations of religious texts.

In the Old Testament, the concept of 'cleansing' often refers to ritual purification from physical impurities such as leprosy or contamination from dead bodies, as well as spiritual cleansing from sins. This is reflected in various laws and rituals, like the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).

However, in the New Testament, Jesus Christ's teachings focus more on inner purification rather than external rituals for forgiveness of sins. In Christianity, the concept of sin and redemption revolves around acknowledging one's sins, seeking God's forgiveness, and striving to live a righteous life.

Jesus' teachings emphasize love, compassion, and forgiveness over strict adherence to ritualistic laws. The shedding of Jesus' blood on the cross is symbolic of atonement for humanity's sins, providing a way for individuals to be spiritually cleansed and reconciled with God.

This shift from ritualistic purification to personal redemption through faith in Christ is a central theme that links Old Testament teachings about cleansing with New Testament teachings about sin and redemption. It's essential to remember that interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations and individual beliefs.
