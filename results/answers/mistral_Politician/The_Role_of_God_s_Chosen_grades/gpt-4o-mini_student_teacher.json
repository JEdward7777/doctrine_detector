  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thoughtful analysis of the concept of 'chosenness' in relation to figures like Moses and King David. However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders and its implications for the Christian community. The student could strengthen their answer by explicitly connecting the concept of 'chosenness' to God's divine purpose and plans for leadership among His followers, as stated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
