The explanation is coherent and aligns well with the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders within the Christian community. The use of biblical references and the emphasis on God's divine purpose and plans for leadership are commendable. The only slight limitation is a lack of direct application to the Christian community beyond the historical context, which could have strengthened the response further."
