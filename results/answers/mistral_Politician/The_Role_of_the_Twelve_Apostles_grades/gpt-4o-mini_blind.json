However, the answer lacks depth in explaining the theological significance of the Twelve Apostles within Christian belief. It approaches the topic more from a historical and social perspective rather than focusing on their spiritual significance and role in the foundation of the Christian faith. Additionally, the answer does not address the unique calling and authority given to the Twelve Apostles by Jesus. A stronger emphasis on doctrinal correctness and theological importance would have enhanced the response."
