  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the student acknowledges the importance of the Twelve Apostles in spreading Jesus' message and establishing the Christian faith, there is a lack of emphasis on their specific role in Christian belief and ministry. The response leans more towards general historical significance rather than highlighting the theological significance of the apostles in Christian tradition. There is a need for greater emphasis on the apostles' role in laying the foundation of the early Church and their specific contributions to Christian ministry."
