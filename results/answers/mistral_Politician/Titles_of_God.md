1. El-Shaddai: This title appears throughout the Old Testament, such as in Genesis 17:1, 28:3, and Exodus 6:3. The meaning of El-Shaddai is often interpreted as "Almighty God" or "God Almighty."

2. Elohim: This title appears frequently in the Old Testament (over 2000 times) and can be translated as "God" or "Gods." However, when used with singular verbs it often refers to a single deity, such as the one true God. The term "Elohim" can be understood as "Mighty One" or "Almighty One."

3. Adonai: This title is usually translated as "Lord" in English versions of the Bible. In Hebrew, it means "Master," "Sovereign," or "Owner," and is a term used to show reverence and respect for God's authority and power. While not specifically referring to Almighty, it signifies God's omnipotence and ultimate control over all things.

4. Jehovah: This name of God is derived from the Hebrew word "Hayah" (I AM), which appears in Exodus 3:14. In the Old Testament, this name is often used to denote the self-existent, eternal nature of God and His sovereignty over all things. While not a direct translation of 'Almighty,' it conveys the idea of God's omnipotence and unchangeableness.

5. Yahweh-Tzva'ot: This title, found in Isaiah 6:3, means "Lord of Hosts" or "Lord Sabaoth." The term "Hosts" (Tzva'ot) refers to God's army, symbolizing His power and dominion over all created beings. It can be seen as an expression of God's almightiness and supreme authority.
