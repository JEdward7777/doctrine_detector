  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided an excellent answer detailing various titles used in the Bible that refer to God as 'Almighty.' The references to specific Bible verses and the explanations of the meanings behind each title are thorough and accurate. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide a bit more depth on the significance and context of each title within the overall narrative of the Bible."
