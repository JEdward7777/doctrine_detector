  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of titles used in the Bible that signify God's power and authority, showcasing a strong understanding of various names and their meanings. While the specific phrase 'Almighty' was not directly mentioned in all examples, the student's explanations effectively demonstrate how each title reflects God's character as Almighty. It would have been stronger if the student had directly referenced the phrase 'Almighty' as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, well done."
