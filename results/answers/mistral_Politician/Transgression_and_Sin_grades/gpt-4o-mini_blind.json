The explanation lacks a clear foundation in Christian beliefs regarding sin and disobedience, focusing more on societal norms and inclusivity. A more robust theological analysis, grounded in Biblical teachings on sin as rebellion against God's moral law and disobedience as a rejection of divine authority, would have strengthened the response. The student should strive to integrate Christian perspectives more prominently when discussing theological concepts such as sin and transgression."
