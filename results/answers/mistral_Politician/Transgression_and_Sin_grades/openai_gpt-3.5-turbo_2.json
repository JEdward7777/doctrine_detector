The focus on political correctness and broad societal norms detracts from the significance of personal accountability and the eternal implications of transgression in relation to one's relationship with God. More emphasis on the seriousness of transgression and the need for repentance and reconciliation with God would be beneficial for a Christian worldview perspective."
