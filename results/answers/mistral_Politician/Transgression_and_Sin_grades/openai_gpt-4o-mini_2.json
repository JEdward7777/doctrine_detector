  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response adequately addresses the concern by emphasizing the connection between transgression and sin/disobedience in relation to God's boundaries, reflecting a Christian worldview. However, the response could have more explicitly highlighted the spiritual consequences and severity of transgression in one's relationship with God to further deepen the analysis. Overall, a solid understanding is showcased with room for additional depth and clarity."
