However, it lacks depth in discussing the theological and spiritual reasons behind the cessation of Tabernacle use. A Christian specific worldview would emphasize the fulfillment of God's plan and the symbolic significance of moving from the Tabernacle to the Temple, highlighting the progression of salvation history. Additionally, the response could have mentioned the themes of covenant, sacrifice, and the presence of God in relation to the Tabernacle."
