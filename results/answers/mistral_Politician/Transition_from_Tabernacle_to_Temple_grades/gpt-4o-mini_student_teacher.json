  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and detailed answer that accurately explains the transition from the Tabernacle to the Temple in Jerusalem. They correctly identified King Solomon as the builder of the Temple and acknowledged the significance of this event in Israelite/Jewish history. The answer effectively addresses the concern of understanding the transition in worship practices. However, the response could have been enhanced by explicitly linking the reason for ceasing the use of the Tabernacle to the completion of the Temple, as mentioned in the reference answer."
