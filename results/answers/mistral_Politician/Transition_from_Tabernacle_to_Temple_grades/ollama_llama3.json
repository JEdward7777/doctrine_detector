  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of why the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle, clearly explaining the transition from the portable sanctuary to the permanent Temple in Jerusalem. The answer meets the concern by providing a detailed account of the events and their significance. The only area for improvement is that the response could have been even more concise and focused on the specific question being addressed (the reason why the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle). Nevertheless, the overall quality of the response is high, demonstrating a good understanding of biblical history and cultural context.\n\nNote: I've taken into account the Christian-specific worldview concern by considering the biblical accounts and historical accuracy in the response."
