# Answer by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a neutral and fact-based AI model, I don't have personal beliefs or feelings. However, I can share information about historical events such as the use of the Tabernacle by the Israelites. The Tabernacle was a portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their 40-year journey in the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt (around 1200 BCE). It was a central religious and cultural symbol for them, where they could worship God.

The reason the Israelites ceased using the Tabernacle is that, according to biblical accounts, once they entered the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership, they settled in various cities. At this point, King Solomon constructed the First Temple in Jerusalem (around 960 BCE), which became the central place of worship for the Israelites and eventually the Jews. The Tabernacle was then no longer used as a primary religious symbol or gathering place. This transition is described in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in books like Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.

In addressing why the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle, it's essential to remember that this event occurred thousands of years ago and carries significant cultural and religious significance for many people today. It is crucial to handle such topics with sensitivity, respect, and historical accuracy, especially when discussing them in diverse communities.
