However, there are some inaccuracies in the translations provided. The phrase \"Zengin Allah\" in Turkish, for example, means \"Rich God\" rather than conveying the intended meaning of \"Almighty God.\" Additionally, the statement regarding maintaining political correctness and respecting cultural sensitivities may not align with a Christian-specific worldview, where doctrinal accuracy and theological correctness take precedence over political correctness. The answer could be improved by focusing more on the accuracy of the translations and providing explanations for the significance of the phrase \"El Shaddai\" in Christian theology."
