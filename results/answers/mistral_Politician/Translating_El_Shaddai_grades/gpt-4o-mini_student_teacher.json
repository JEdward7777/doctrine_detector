  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive list of translations for \"El Shaddai\" in various languages, the primary concern of accurately representing God's name across different cultures and languages was not fully addressed. The reference answer from the teacher clearly states that 'El Shaddai' can be translated as 'God Almighty' or 'Shaddai', focusing on the accuracy of the translation rather than cultural sensitivities. The student's answer touched on respecting cultural sensitivities but did not prioritize the accuracy of God's name representation. Additional emphasis on maintaining the accuracy of God's name translation would have improved the student's response."
