Grade: 80

The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for the Hebrew phrase "El Shaddai" in various languages, taking into account cultural and linguistic sensitivities. This shows a clear understanding of the importance of accurately representing God's name across different cultures and languages.

However, the response does not directly address the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name. Instead, it focuses on providing translations that convey the meaning of "El Shaddai" as a powerful, almighty God. While this is an important aspect, it does not necessarily ensure accuracy in representing God's name across different cultures and languages.

To improve the response, the author could have provided more context on why these specific translations are accurate representations of God's name in their respective cultures and languages. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concern and provide a stronger justification for the given translations.
