However, the emphasis on cultural sensitivities and respect may lead to potential dilution of the specific meaning and significance of \"El Shaddai\" as a powerful and almighty God. While it is important to be inclusive, the primary concern of accurately representing God's name across cultures could have been highlighted more prominently in the response."
