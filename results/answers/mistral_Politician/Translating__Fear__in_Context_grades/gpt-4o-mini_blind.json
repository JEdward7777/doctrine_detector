The importance of understanding these translations should have been emphasized within the Christian context, highlighting the biblical teachings on the fear of the Lord. The answer would benefit from integrating scriptural references and theological insights to support the understanding of fear in relation to God from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the focus on inclusivity and sensitivity could be complemented with the doctrinal importance of reverential fear in fostering a deeper relationship with God."
