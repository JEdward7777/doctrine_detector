  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provides a well-reasoned explanation for why retaining the terms \"Zion\" and \"daughter\" in translations of Biblical texts is important, highlighting their historical, theological, and symbolic significance. They effectively convey the deeper meanings behind these terms and address how altering them could impact the intended message of the text. The student acknowledges the complexities of language and the importance of balancing sensitivity with historical accuracy in translations. Overall, their response aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher.\n\nThe reason for not giving a perfect score is that the student's response could have been further enhanced by including more explicit references to the spiritual and cultural significance of these terms within a Christian worldview. They successfully address the importance of historical accuracy and context but could strengthen their argument by connecting these points more directly to the teachings and beliefs of Christianity."
