The focus on maintaining the spiritual and cultural significance of the original text aligns with Christian principles of interpreting and translating sacred scriptures with respect and accuracy. Just a minor deduction for not explicitly mentioning the importance of preserving historical accuracy alongside maintaining spiritual and cultural significance, as this balance is crucial in translating religious texts from a Christian worldview."
