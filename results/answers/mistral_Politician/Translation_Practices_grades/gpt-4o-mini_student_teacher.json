  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response includes some relevant information about the tradition of using \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\" in Bible translations and acknowledges the respect for God's name. However, the student's answer veers off track by mentioning political correctness and does not directly address the concern of clarity in translation of sacred texts. The response could have been more concise and focused on the specific concern provided."
