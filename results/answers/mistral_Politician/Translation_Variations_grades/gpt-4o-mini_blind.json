  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a diverse range of alternative translations for 'covenant faithfulness' that effectively convey the core concepts of commitment, loyalty, trustworthiness, and reliability without relying on overtly religious language. While the translations are well thought out and clearly explained, some may miss the depth of theological implications inherent in the term 'covenant faithfulness' from a Christian perspective. Overall, the student has demonstrated creativity and understanding in providing alternative translations."
