  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the difference in usage of the term \"Lord\" when referring to God versus ordinary people. They correctly address the capitalization of \"Lord\" when used in a religious context and the significance of conveying respect and reverence. The answer also touches on the importance of cultural sensitivity and clear communication. However, the student could have provided a more concise and focused explanation specifically relating to biblical terms and the nature of God to align more closely with the Christian worldview."
