  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the distinction between the translation of \"Lord\" in religious and secular contexts. They accurately explain the capitalization of the term when referring to God and its secular connotation when referring to ordinary people. The inclusion of examples and a discussion of cultural sensitivity adds depth to the response. However, the student could benefit from providing additional examples or clarifying the regional variations in the usage of the term."
