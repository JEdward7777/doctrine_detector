  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides some insight into the capitalization of \"Lord\" in English, but its understanding of the term's connotation and usage is limited to a brief description without much depth or biblical context. While it acknowledges the importance of cultural sensitivity and clear communication, it does not explicitly address the concern about proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impacting the understanding of scripture and the nature of God. The answer provided also oversimplifies the term's meaning, failing to capture its rich theological significance. To improve this response, the writer could have explored the biblical contexts where \"Lord\" is used to refer to God, highlighting its deep spiritual connotation and implications for our understanding of God's character and relationship with humanity."
