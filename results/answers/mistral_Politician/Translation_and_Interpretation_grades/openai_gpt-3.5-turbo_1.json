  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of how the term 'Lord' is used in both religious and secular contexts, highlighting the significance of capitalization when referring to God versus ordinary individuals. The explanation is clear and concise, addressing the concern of proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms. The only suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the importance of accurately conveying the divine nature and authority of God when using the term 'Lord' in a Christian context."
