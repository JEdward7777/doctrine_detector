  "grade_comment": "Grade: 88\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the different connotations of the term \"Lord\" based on its usage for God versus ordinary individuals, and it acknowledges the importance of clear communication and cultural sensitivity in using such terms. It correctly highlights the significance of capitalization in distinguishing the spiritual connotation when referring to God. However, the response could have delved deeper into how proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impact the understanding of scripture and the nature of God from a Christian worldview perspective. More explicit connections to the theological implications of accurate translations and interpretations would have strengthened the response."
