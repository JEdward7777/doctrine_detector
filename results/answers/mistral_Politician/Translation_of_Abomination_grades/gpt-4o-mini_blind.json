  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's answer emphasizes sensitivity and respect in conveying the meaning of 'abomination,' it falls short in accurately capturing the strong biblical connotation of the term. In a Christian worldview, 'abomination' conveys a significant moral offense against God's standards rather than just being \"deeply troubling\" or \"morally controversial.\" The answer also leans more towards cultural sensitivity and inclusivity rather than focusing on biblical truth and accuracy, which are paramount in this context. While being respectful is important, it should not come at the cost of diluting the biblical meaning of such a significant term."
