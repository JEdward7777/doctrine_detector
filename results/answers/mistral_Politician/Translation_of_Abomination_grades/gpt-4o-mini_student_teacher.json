  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's answer promotes sensitivity and respect in communication, it falls short in accurately conveying the severity and moral implications associated with the term 'abomination' in a biblical context. The reference answer provides more suitable translations that better capture the gravity of actions against God's laws, which is crucial for understanding the biblical text from a Christian worldview. The student's response, although well-intentioned, lacks the depth and clarity necessary to communicate the seriousness of the term as it is used in the Bible."
