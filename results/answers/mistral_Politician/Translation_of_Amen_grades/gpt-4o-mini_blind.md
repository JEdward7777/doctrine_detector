Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of potential translations for 'truly' used by Jesus, demonstrating a good understanding of the nuance in the original language. However, it would have been even better if the student had included a closer connection to Biblical context or referenced the original Greek word used for 'truly' for a more thorough analysis.
