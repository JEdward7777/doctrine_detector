Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a variety of potential translations for 'truly' used by Jesus, demonstrating a good understanding of the nuances in translation. However, the reference answer from the teacher emphasizes the sincerity and truthfulness of the statement, which was not explicitly captured in all the student's responses. Overall, the student showed a strong knowledge of potential translations but could have emphasized the sincerity aspect more clearly in their translations.
