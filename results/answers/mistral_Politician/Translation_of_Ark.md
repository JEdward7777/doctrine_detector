## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the Christian Bible, the term "ark" primarily refers to Noah's Ark in the Old Testament (Genesis 6:14-22). However, it's important to note that translations of the Bible may vary, and the term can be translated slightly differently depending on the version used. For example, the King James Version uses "ark" throughout, while other versions like the New International Version sometimes use "ark of salvation."

In the New Testament, there is no direct equivalent to Noah's Ark. In the apocryphal book of 2 Maccabees, a "ark" or "ark of the covenant" is mentioned (2 Maccabees 2:4-8), but this is not the same as Noah's Ark and has a different context within Judaism.

When discussing these various uses in a politically correct manner, it's essential to acknowledge the diverse interpretations and understandings of religious texts among different communities. It's always best to use respectful language that encourages open dialogue and avoids causing offense or confusion.
