It shows awareness of the importance of accurately translating terms in scripture to grasp their contextual meaning. The response could benefit from mentioning the broader significance of these arks within a Christian worldview, tying them back to themes of salvation, protection, and covenant. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of proper interpretation within the theological framework of Christianity would strengthen the response further."
