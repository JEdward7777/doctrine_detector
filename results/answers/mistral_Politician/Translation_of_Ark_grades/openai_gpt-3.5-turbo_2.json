  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the term \"ark\" in different contexts within the Christian Bible, demonstrating a good understanding of the variations in its meaning. The response also acknowledges the importance of accurate translation and contextual understanding in interpreting scripture. However, the inclusion of the apocryphal book of 2 Maccabees, while informative, could have been further emphasized in relation to its non-canonical status. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern raised."
