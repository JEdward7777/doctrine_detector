  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a variety of translations for the term 'church', some of which do reflect the inclusive nature of the church as a gathering of all believers. However, the translations provided by the student focus more on the physical or community aspects of a church rather than specifically addressing the concern of accurately representing the church's inclusive nature. To improve the grade, the student should consider translations that more directly convey the idea of gathering all believers together."
