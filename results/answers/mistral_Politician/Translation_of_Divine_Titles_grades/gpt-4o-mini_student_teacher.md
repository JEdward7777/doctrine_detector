## Question [Translation of Divine Titles](../../../questions/Translation_of_Divine_Titles.md)
How should the term 'Lord Yahweh' be translated in different languages to maintain its meaning?

## Correct Answer
It can be translated as 'Lord God' or 'God who is the Lord,' and it's important to consider grammatical structure in the target language.

## Stated Concern
Proper translation helps convey the accurate meaning of God's titles and presence in Scripture.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Divine_Titles.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 To ensure that the translation maintains respect and accuracy while being sensitive to cultural and linguistic differences, here are some suggestions for translating "Lord Yahweh" into several common languages:

1. English (United States): Lord Yahweh can be translated as "The Lord God" or simply "God." In the Bible, "Yahweh" is often translated as "the LORD," with all capital letters to signify His divine nature.

2. Spanish: Señor Yahveh can be translated as "Señor Dios" (Lord God).

3. French: Seigneur Yahve can be translated as "Seigneur Dieu" (Lord God).

4. German: Herr Yahweh can be translated as "Herr Gott" (Lord God).

5. Mandarin Chinese: 主贤大圣 (Zhǔxián dàshèng) translates to "Lord Almighty," which is a title often used for God in Christianity, though "Yahweh" itself may not have a direct translation in Chinese.

6. Arabic: Rabb Yahūḥā can be translated as "الرب يحوه" (Ar-Rabbu Yahūḥā), which is the way the name of God (God of Israel) is written in the Quran using a transliteration from Hebrew.

7. Hebrew: Adonai YHWH can be translated as "אדוני יהוה" (Adonai Yehovah), which consists of two separate terms: "Adonai," meaning "my lord," and "Yehovah," the Hebrew spelling of Yahweh.

8. Japanese: Yahwe no Onesama can be translated as "ヤヒーの恩恵様" (Yahī no onkei-sama), which translates to "Lord Yahveh, Lord of Mercy."

9. Korean: Yahweh-nim can be translated as "예수님" (Yesu-nim) or "하나님" (Hana-nim), both meaning "Lord," though neither are exact translations for "Yahweh."

10. Russian: Господь Иегова can be translated as "Господь Бог" (Gospod' Bog), which means "Lord God."
