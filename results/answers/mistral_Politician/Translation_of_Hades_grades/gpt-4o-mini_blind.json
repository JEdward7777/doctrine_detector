It is crucial to uphold the doctrinal integrity of these terms in a Christian worldview. The suggested translations lack the specificity and depth required to capture the rich theological significance found in the biblical context. The focus on avoiding potential offense compromises the clarity and accuracy needed for a Christian audience seeking a faithful understanding of these terms. The emphasis should always be on conveying the biblical meanings with precision, even if it may not align with every individual's beliefs."
