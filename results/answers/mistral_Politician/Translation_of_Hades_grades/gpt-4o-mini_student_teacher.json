  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates an effort to respect diverse beliefs and use inclusive language, which is commendable. However, the response strays from accurately representing the biblical meanings of 'Hades' and 'Sheol' by focusing more on sensitivity and political correctness rather than maintaining fidelity to the original texts. The suggested translations are more focused on avoiding offense rather than accurately conveying the biblical concepts. The student could improve their answer by prioritizing biblical accuracy while also considering inclusivity."
