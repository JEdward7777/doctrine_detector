  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concern for accurate biblical representation and respectful communication. They provide insightful suggestions for translating 'Hades' and 'Sheol' in a politically correct manner, considering diverse religious perspectives. While their suggested alternatives are appropriate, the response could benefit from including the suggested translations provided by the teacher, such as \"place of the dead\" and \"retained as with explanatory phrases.\" Overall, this is a well-written and articulate response that addresses the prompt thoughtfully."
