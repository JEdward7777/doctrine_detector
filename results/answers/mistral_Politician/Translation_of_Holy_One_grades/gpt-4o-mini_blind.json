However, from a Christian perspective, the term \"Holy One\" is often used to refer specifically to God or Jesus Christ in the Bible. This theological nuance should be acknowledged in the translations provided. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include explanations or references to the biblical usage of the term to deepen the theological accuracy of the translations."
