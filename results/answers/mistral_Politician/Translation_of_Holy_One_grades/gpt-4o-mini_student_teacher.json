  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has shown effort in providing translations in various languages and recognizing the importance of cultural and linguistic sensitivities. However, the key concern in maintaining the theological implications of the term \"Holy One\" was not directly addressed in their response. The reference answer highlights the significance of retaining the meaning of holiness, which the student's translations did not consistently capture. Additionally, while collaboration with local scholars and religious leaders was rightly suggested, a clearer connection to ensuring theological accuracy in translations is needed for a higher grade."
