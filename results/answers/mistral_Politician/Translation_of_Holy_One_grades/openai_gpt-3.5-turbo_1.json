The emphasis on collaborating with local experts to ensure accuracy and appropriateness demonstrates a commitment to maintaining the theological significance of the term in different cultural contexts. However, the response could have delved deeper into how specific theological connotations were preserved in each proposed translation to further address the concern of maintaining theological implications across languages."
