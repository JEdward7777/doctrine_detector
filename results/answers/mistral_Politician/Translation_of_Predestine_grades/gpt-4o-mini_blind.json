  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a variety of alternative translations for the term 'predestined' and has attempted to avoid direct religious connotations. While some of the suggestions provided align with the intended goal, a Christian-specific worldview would prioritize the doctrinal accuracy of the term 'predestined' over simply avoiding religious connotations. Some of the alternatives, like \"fated\" and \"naturally occurring,\" may not capture the full theological significance of predestination within Christian belief. It would have been beneficial for the student to include options that align more closely with the Biblical concept of predestination as understood within Christian theology."
