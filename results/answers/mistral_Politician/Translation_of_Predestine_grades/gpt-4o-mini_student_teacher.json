  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided several alternative translations for the term 'predestined,' which avoid religious connotations, but do not fully capture the specific biblical meaning tied to the concept of predestination. The translations offered by the student, while valid in a general sense, lack the precision required when discussing biblical concepts. The reference answer from the teacher better reflects the accurate understanding of biblical translations related to predestination."
