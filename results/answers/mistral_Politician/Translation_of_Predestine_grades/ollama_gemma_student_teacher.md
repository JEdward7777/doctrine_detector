## [Answer](../Translation_of_Predestine.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
1. "Meant to happen": This term implies that events, including personal circumstances or outcomes, have been determined beforehand without human intervention, but avoids religious connotations associated with the word "predestined."

2. "Fated": Similar to "predestined," this term suggests that an event is inevitable, but it has a more neutral and less specific connotation than the religious meaning of "predestined."

3. "Naturally occurring" or "occurring by nature": This phrase emphasizes the idea that events are determined without human intervention, while also avoiding any implication of predetermination by a higher power.

4. "Inevitable" or "unavoidable": These terms suggest that something is certain to happen, but they do not imply any predetermined plan or agency behind the event.

5. "Destined to occur" or "bound to happen": These phrases communicate that an event seems inevitable or inescapable without implying a predetermined or religious element.

6. "Preordained" or "set in stone": These terms suggest something has been determined beforehand but do not necessarily imply a higher power or divine intervention. They can be used to describe events or circumstances that are unchangeable or certain to occur.

7. "Determined" or "decided ahead of time": This phrase emphasizes the idea that an event has been decided or set in advance without human agency, but it does not necessarily imply predestination by a higher power.
