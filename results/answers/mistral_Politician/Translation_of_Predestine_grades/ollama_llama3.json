  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good start by offering alternative translations for \"meant to happen\". However, it could be improved by more explicitly connecting these alternatives to biblical concepts related to predestination. For example, the response could have drawn parallels between the ideas presented and biblical passages that discuss God's sovereignty over human events (e.g., Romans 8:28-30). Additionally, the response could have more thoroughly explored how the alternatives presented might inform or challenge our understanding of predestination in a biblical context. Overall, while the response shows some promise, it could benefit from greater depth and connection to relevant biblical themes."
