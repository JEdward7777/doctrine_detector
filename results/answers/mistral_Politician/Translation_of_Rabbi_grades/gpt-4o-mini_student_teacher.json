  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 85.\n\nThe student has demonstrated a good understanding of the various considerations that should be made when translating the term \"Rabbi\" in different languages. They have addressed important factors such as respect for religious traditions, language-specific conventions, sensitivity to local customs, cultural sensitivity, consistency, avoiding misinterpretation, inclusivity and accuracy, as well as the importance of consultation with relevant experts.\n\nHowever, the student's answer lacks a direct focus on ensuring the accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith, as specified in the concern. While the considerations mentioned are valuable in general translation work, the answer should have been more explicitly tied to how the translation of \"Rabbi\" should align with Christian beliefs about Jesus' unique role as a teacher within the faith.\n\nOverall, the student's response is comprehensive and thoughtful, but it could be improved by providing a more direct link to the specified concern."
