  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response addresses important considerations such as maintaining respect for religious traditions, language-specific conventions, sensitivity to local customs, cultural sensitivity, consistency, avoiding misinterpretation, inclusivity and accuracy, and consultation. These factors are vital when translating a religious title like \"Rabbi\" to ensure accurate representation within the Christian faith.

Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the complexity involved in translating religious titles while respecting cultural and religious sensitivities."
