  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to the concern of accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith when translating the term \"Rabbi.\" It addresses the importance of respecting religious traditions, language-specific conventions, sensitivity to local customs, cultural sensitivity, consistency, avoiding misinterpretation, inclusivity, accuracy, and consultation, all of which are crucial aspects to consider from a Christian worldview. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning the Christian perspective or worldview in the response, as this could further strengthen the connection to the concern at hand."
