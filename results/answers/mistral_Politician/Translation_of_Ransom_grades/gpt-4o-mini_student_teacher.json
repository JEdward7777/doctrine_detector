  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a variety of translations for the term 'ransom' in different languages, taking into consideration the context in which it is used, particularly when referring to the payment made for someone's release. However, some translations may not fully capture the theological significance of 'ransom' as described in the reference answer. Encouraging continued emphasis on maintaining theological accuracy across linguistic and cultural contexts would help improve the overall grade."
