3. French: Rançon (Ransom, as in a payment made for someone's release from captivity)

6. Portuguese: Resgate (Rescue, extraction from a dangerous situation or place) - To indicate ransom money, the terms "rescate" or "cobrar rescate" are used.
7. Dutch: Losgeld (Ransom money or ransom payment)
8. Russian: Кормление заложником (Feeding a hostage, though this term is not commonly used to refer to the monetary payment made for someone's release) - The more common phrase is "выкуп" (vykup), which translates as ransom or redemption.
9. Chinese: 救赎金 (Jiú shè jīn, Ransom money or redemption fee paid to secure the release of someone)
10. Arabic: Jizyah (A tax levied on non-Muslims in Islamic territories historically, not commonly used for ransom in contemporary usage) - Instead, use "مدفوعة لتحرير" (Madfa'ah li tahrir), which means "Ransom for release".

12. Korean: 협박금 (Hyeopbak-gam, Extortion fee, though it can be used in the context of ransom) - A more appropriate term would be "배난금" (beonan-geum), which means "Kidnap and Ransom Money".
