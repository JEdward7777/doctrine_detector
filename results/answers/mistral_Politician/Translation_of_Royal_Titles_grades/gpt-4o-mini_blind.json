  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 90.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive list of translations for the phrase \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, showcasing a good understanding of linguistic nuances and variations. The translations seem accurate and well-researched. However, to achieve a higher grade, the student could have included a brief explanation or context for each translation to demonstrate a deeper understanding of cultural and linguistic considerations when addressing royalty. Overall, a solid effort with room for slight improvement in terms of contextual detail."
