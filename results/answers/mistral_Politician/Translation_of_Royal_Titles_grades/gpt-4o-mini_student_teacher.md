Grade: 50

Comment: While the student provided a comprehensive list of translations for 'Your Majesty' in various languages, the concern of ensuring accurate and respectful translations of titles in the context of biblical teachings was not fully addressed. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes translating it as 'your Highness,' 'your Excellency,' or using a natural way of addressing a ruler in the target language, which the student's answer did not align with completely. There was a lack of consideration for biblical teachings in the translations provided.
