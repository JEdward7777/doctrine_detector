  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the provided translations are accurate, I deduct points because they do not directly address the concern of ensuring respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings. The initial answer's suggestion to translate \"Your Majesty\" as \"your Highness,\" \"your Excellency,\" or using a natural way of addressing a ruler in the target language does not take into account the unique cultural and historical contexts in which biblical stories were written.\n\nA higher score would require more attention to the concern about respecting the original biblical teachings, particularly when it comes to addressing rulers."
