Comment: The response provides a variety of translations for "Your Majesty" in different languages, which is helpful for understanding cultural nuances. However, the concern about ensuring accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings is not directly addressed. While the translations presented are correct in a linguistic sense, a Christian-specific worldview could have been incorporated by emphasizing the importance of showing respect and humility towards authority figures, reflecting biblical teachings on honoring rulers and leaders.
