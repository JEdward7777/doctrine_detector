However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it is important to consider biblical teachings on respect and honor, especially when addressing rulers. While the translations provided may be accurate linguistically, they may not always align with the idea of respect and honor as emphasized in the Bible. Therefore, the response could have emphasized the importance of choosing translations that uphold biblical principles of respect and honor when addressing royalty."
