However, the concern from a Christian perspective is ensuring accurate and respectful translations in line with biblical teachings. While the translations provided are linguistically accurate, without specific references to biblical teachings on addressing authority figures, the response lacks a direct connection to a Christian worldview. Further elaboration on how biblical principles influence respectful language towards rulers would strengthen the response."
