What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Target answer from notes
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In a context that aims for political correctness and avoids any religious connotations, it would be more appropriate to use terms such as "venerated figures," "inspirational individuals," or "revered role models" instead of "saints." These phrases carry the essence of admiration and respect while avoiding potential misunderstandings or offenses related to religion.
