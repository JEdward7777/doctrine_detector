## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In a context that aims for political correctness and avoids any religious connotations, it would be more appropriate to use terms such as "venerated figures," "inspirational individuals," or "revered role models" instead of "saints." These phrases carry the essence of admiration and respect while avoiding potential misunderstandings or offenses related to religion.

Grade: 50

Comment: The answer provided addresses the question from a secular perspective focusing on political correctness, but it lacks consideration of the term 'saints' within a Christian specific worldview. In a Christian context, 'saints' refers to believers who have been sanctified and set apart by God, not merely venerated or admired individuals. To provide a more accurate translation, it would be important to emphasize the spiritual significance of 'saints' in Christianity.
