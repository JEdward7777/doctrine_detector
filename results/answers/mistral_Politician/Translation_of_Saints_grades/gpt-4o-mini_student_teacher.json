  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response falls short of accurately reflecting a Christian worldview perspective. While the student attempts to provide alternative terms that avoid religious connotations, the suggested phrases lack the specific Christian understanding of the term 'saints' as believers in Jesus who are set apart for God's purposes. The use of terms like \"venerated figures\" or \"inspirational individuals\" does not capture the theological significance of being a saint in Christian belief. The answer could benefit from incorporating language that more closely aligns with the Christian understanding of saints."
