## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In a context that aims for political correctness and avoids any religious connotations, it would be more appropriate to use terms such as "venerated figures," "inspirational individuals," or "revered role models" instead of "saints." These phrases carry the essence of admiration and respect while avoiding potential misunderstandings or offenses related to religion.

Grade: 40

Comment: The student's response falls short of accurately reflecting a Christian worldview perspective. While the student attempts to provide alternative terms that avoid religious connotations, the suggested phrases lack the specific Christian understanding of the term 'saints' as believers in Jesus who are set apart for God's purposes. The use of terms like "venerated figures" or "inspirational individuals" does not capture the theological significance of being a saint in Christian belief. The answer could benefit from incorporating language that more closely aligns with the Christian understanding of saints.
