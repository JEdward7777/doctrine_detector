  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the original response acknowledges the importance of using inclusive language, it falls short in providing effective alternatives that accurately represent all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. The suggestion to use \"holy ones,\" \"holy people,\" or \"holy believers in Jesus\" is too narrow and assumes a specific Christian context.\n\nIn contrast, the provided response acknowledges the importance of avoiding specific Christian connotations while still conveying respect and admiration for those who inspire others. While it may not fully address the concern about inclusivity, it shows an understanding that \"saints\" can be perceived as exclusive to certain religious groups.\n\nTo improve this response, consider providing more inclusive language options that transcend specific Christian denominations or affiliations."
