## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In a context that aims for political correctness and avoids any religious connotations, it would be more appropriate to use terms such as "venerated figures," "inspirational individuals," or "revered role models" instead of "saints." These phrases carry the essence of admiration and respect while avoiding potential misunderstandings or offenses related to religion.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

While the original response acknowledges the importance of using inclusive language, it falls short in providing effective alternatives that accurately represent all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. The suggestion to use "holy ones," "holy people," or "holy believers in Jesus" is too narrow and assumes a specific Christian context.

In contrast, the provided response acknowledges the importance of avoiding specific Christian connotations while still conveying respect and admiration for those who inspire others. While it may not fully address the concern about inclusivity, it shows an understanding that "saints" can be perceived as exclusive to certain religious groups.

To improve this response, consider providing more inclusive language options that transcend specific Christian denominations or affiliations.
