## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In a context that aims for political correctness and avoids any religious connotations, it would be more appropriate to use terms such as "venerated figures," "inspirational individuals," or "revered role models" instead of "saints." These phrases carry the essence of admiration and respect while avoiding potential misunderstandings or offenses related to religion.

70.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
I would grade this response a 70.

While the suggested translations do highlight the concept of holiness, they still specifically reference Jesus, which may not fully address the concern of using inclusive language for all believers in Jesus without singling out specific Christian groups. The response could have included more generic terms like "faithful followers," "devoted believers," or "upright individuals," to better encompass a wider range of Christian believers without emphasizing a particular denomination.
