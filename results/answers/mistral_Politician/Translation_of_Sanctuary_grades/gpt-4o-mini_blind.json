  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 70.\n\nWhile the answer provides some good points on being sensitive and clear in translating the term 'sanctuary' in modern texts, it lacks a Christian-specific worldview. The student does not address the term's significance in Christian theology, missing an important aspect of translating such a term accurately. A Christian perspective would emphasize the biblical meanings and implications of sanctuary, tying it to God's protection, refuge, and presence for His people.\n\nAdditionally, the answer could benefit from incorporating the importance of accurately conveying the spiritual and theological depth of 'sanctuary' in Christian contexts, as it goes beyond just physical safety and refuge. Integrating these aspects would strengthen the response and align it more closely with a Christian worldview."
