  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student's response demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of cultural sensitivity and the importance of clear communication, the concern raised in the reference answer specifically focused on maintaining the original Biblical meaning of the term 'sanctuary.' The student's answer did not directly address this aspect, which is critical from a Christian worldview in ensuring the accurate translation and understanding of Biblical terms. The response could have been enhanced by including a specific emphasis on preserving the sacred and holy significance of 'sanctuary' in line with its Biblical definition."
