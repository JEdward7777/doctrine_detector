  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the implications of translating 'trespass' as 'sin' or 'breaking the rule' within a church community. The student successfully highlights potential issues related to religious connotations, potential misinterpretations, moralizing behavior, pastoral care, and inclusive language. However, the response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the doctrinal significance of sin within a Christian worldview. Moreover, the student could further elaborate on how using the term 'sin' can align with the biblical teachings on reconciliation, repentance, and restoration within the church community."
