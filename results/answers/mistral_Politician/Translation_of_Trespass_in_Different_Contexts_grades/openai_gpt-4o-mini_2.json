  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the implications of translating 'trespass' as 'sin' or 'breaking the rule' within a church community, highlighting the importance of careful language choices in religious contexts. The considerations regarding religious connotations, potential misinterpretation, moralizing behavior, pastoral care, and inclusive language are all well-articulated and align with the concern of ensuring church teachings align with scriptural integrity and community values from a Christian perspective. The response effectively addresses the concern raised and offers valuable insights for approaching religious language sensitively and inclusively."
