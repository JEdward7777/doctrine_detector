## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In modern, inclusive language, it would be more appropriate to refer to "Yahweh's house" or simply "the temple" if referring to a specific building. This helps avoid any potential misunderstandings or offense that may arise from the term "House of Yahweh," which historically has been associated with a specific religious community and might be perceived as exclusionary by those not affiliated with it.
