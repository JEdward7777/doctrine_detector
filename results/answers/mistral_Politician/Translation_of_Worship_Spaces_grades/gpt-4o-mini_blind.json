In a Christian worldview, the term \"house of Yahweh\" holds deep spiritual significance as it refers to the dwelling place of God and His presence among His people. While the answer attempts to avoid potential misunderstandings and offense, it could have further emphasized the reverence and sacredness associated with the original phrase."
