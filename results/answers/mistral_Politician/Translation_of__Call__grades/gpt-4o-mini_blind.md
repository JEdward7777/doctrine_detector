Comment: 
The student has provided a variety of alternative translations for the phrase 'You must call his name' in a biblical context, showcasing a good understanding of how to convey the meaning in different ways. However, the answer lacks significant depth or specific references to biblical or Christian principles. To improve the grade, the student could have incorporated more direct biblical or theological insights to demonstrate a stronger connection to a Christian worldview.
