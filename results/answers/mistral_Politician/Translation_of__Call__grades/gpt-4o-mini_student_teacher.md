Grade: 70

Comment: The student's responses demonstrate a good understanding of the importance of using the specific name given to someone in a biblical context. However, the student could have delved deeper into the significance of naming within biblical traditions and the theological implications of assigning a name. Additionally, while some responses focus on different aspects such as respect, protocol, and tradition, they could have connected these aspects back to biblical teachings and principles more explicitly. Overall, a solid effort in addressing the concern, but room for deeper analysis and connection to biblical worldview.
