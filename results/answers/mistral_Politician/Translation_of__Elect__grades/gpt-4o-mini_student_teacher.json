  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides a detailed explanation of the differences in translation of \"elect\" between older and modern versions of the Bible and discusses the potential impact on understanding Scripture, the answer lacks a direct focus on the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to the concept of being chosen by God. The student's response does touch on this concept indirectly but could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern provided. Additionally, the student does not fully align with the reference answer which specifically mentions the differentiation between Old and New Testaments in the use of 'elect' and 'chosen ones'.\n\nOverall, the student provides insightful information but could improve by directly addressing the concern and aligning more closely with the reference answer."
