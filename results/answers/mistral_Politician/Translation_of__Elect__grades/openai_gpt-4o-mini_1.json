The writer effectively addressed the concern by discussing how these translation choices can impact readers' understanding of their identity as God's people. The response also emphasized the importance of engaging with multiple translations and seeking deeper insight from trusted sources. However, a more direct connection to a Christian specific worldview, such as incorporating Biblical verses or theological teachings, could have enhanced the response further."
