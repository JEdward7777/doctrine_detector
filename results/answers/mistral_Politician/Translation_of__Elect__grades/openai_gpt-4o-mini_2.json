  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the interpretational differences surrounding the term \"elect\" in older and modern Bible versions, highlighting how language choices can impact the reader's understanding of being chosen by God. It effectively addresses the concern by delving into the historical context and nuances of translation choices. The only minor critique would be to explicitly tie the response back to the idea of being chosen by God as central to the Christian worldview, but overall, the analysis is comprehensive and well-structured."
