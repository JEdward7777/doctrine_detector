The writer also acknowledges the potential controversies surrounding the use of \"Yahweh\" in some Christian denominations.\n\nHowever, while the response touches on the concern about using original names versus cultural practices, it could be more explicitly addressed. The writer seems to lean towards respecting cultural practices, citing the importance of being inclusive and respectful towards all members of a community. While this approach is important, it would have been helpful to more directly address the question of whether using \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\" prioritizes cultural practice over original names.\n\nOverall, the response provides a thoughtful and nuanced discussion, but could benefit from more explicit consideration of the concern about using original names versus cultural practices."
