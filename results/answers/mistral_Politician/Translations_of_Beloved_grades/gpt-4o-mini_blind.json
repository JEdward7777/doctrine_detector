The choices are well-thought-out and considerate of potential cultural sensitivities. However, from a Christian worldview, terms like \"beloved\" or \"dear one\" often carry a deeper spiritual significance found in the Bible, particularly in references to how God loves His people. Encouraging an exploration of such scriptural references could have enhanced the answer further."
