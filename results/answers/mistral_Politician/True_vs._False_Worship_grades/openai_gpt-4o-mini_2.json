However, it falls short of addressing the concern raised from a Christian worldview perspective, which emphasizes the importance of understanding true worship as honoring and obeying Yahweh as the One True God. More emphasis on the uniqueness and exclusivity of Christian worship towards God would have strengthened the Christian viewpoint in this response."
