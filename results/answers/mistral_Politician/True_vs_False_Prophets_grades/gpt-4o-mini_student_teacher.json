The student's response focuses more on promoting harmony and tolerance, critical thinking, integrity, positive impact on society, respect for authorities, and empowerment, which are good traits but do not directly address discerning true prophets from false ones within a Christian framework. The reference answer provides a more concise and Christian-focused approach by highlighting alignment with God's Word, nature of teachings, and fruits of ministry as key factors. The student's answer could be strengthened by incorporating more specific biblical principles and criteria for evaluating prophetic voices from a Christian worldview."
