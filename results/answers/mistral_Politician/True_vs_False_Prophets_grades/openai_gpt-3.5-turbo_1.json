The response effectively addresses the concern of discerning true prophetic voices from misleading ones by focusing on essential criteria. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of discerning false prophets by referencing biblical teachings on testing spirits and discerning falsehoods. This additional biblical foundation would have strengthened the Christian perspective on discerning true prophetic voices."
