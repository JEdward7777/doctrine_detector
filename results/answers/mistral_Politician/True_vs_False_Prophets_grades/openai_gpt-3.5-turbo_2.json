It addresses the concern of discerning true prophetic voices effectively. The response also incorporates key Christian principles such as promoting peace, harmony, and integrity. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the authority of scripture and the importance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate standard for evaluating prophets in a Christian worldview."
