  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to discerning true prophetic voices, aligning well with the Christian worldview. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating messages based on alignment with God's Word, teachings, and ministry fruits. The criteria presented in the response offer a solid framework for discernment in identifying true prophets, promoting spiritual growth, and fostering unity within diverse communities. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly reference the importance of discerning through prayer and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit for ultimate clarity in distinguishing true prophetic voices from misleading ones."
