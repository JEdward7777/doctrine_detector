It involves acknowledging one's shortcomings and accepting Jesus' sacrifice as a way to be reconciled with God. This relationship is built on love, obedience, and submission to Jesus' teachings found in the Bible. Trusting in Jesus also means relying on Him for salvation and guidance throughout life, seeking His will, and striving to live according to Christian principles of love, compassion, forgiveness, and righteousness. This faith is personal, and individuals may express it differently, but its core tenets remain consistent within Christian teachings.
