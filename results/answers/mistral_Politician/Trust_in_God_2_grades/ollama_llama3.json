The response correctly identifies the key aspects of trusting in Jesus, such as believing in His divinity, accepting His sacrifice for sin, and relying on Him for salvation. However, it does not explicitly mention the importance of submitting to Jesus' teachings, seeking His will, or striving to live according to Christian principles, which are all crucial aspects of Christian faith.
