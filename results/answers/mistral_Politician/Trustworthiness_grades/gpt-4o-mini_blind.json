  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that aligns well with Biblical principles on trustworthiness. The references to specific verses from the Bible support the points made, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic. However, there were some elements in the response that seemed more focused on inclusivity and political alignment rather than solely on Biblical principles. A minor improvement would be to emphasize how trustworthiness can be demonstrated without the overlay of a politically minded perspective."
