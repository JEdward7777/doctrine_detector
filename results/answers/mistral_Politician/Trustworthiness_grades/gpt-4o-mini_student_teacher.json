  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response on how to demonstrate trustworthiness based on Biblical principles, referencing relevant scriptures and examples. However, the student's answer focused more on individual actions and virtues rather than how these actions encourage followers to live in accordance with Biblical teachings on integrity and reliability, as specified in the concern. The student's response was well-written and aligned with Christian values, but could have been more directly connected to the concern provided."
