  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments:\nThe answer provides a thoughtful exploration of brotherly love (Agape) and romantic love (Philia or Eros) in the context of the biblical definition of love. It correctly highlights the selfless and sacrificial nature of Agape love and the importance of boundary-constrained romantic love within marriage. The student effectively references biblical passages to support their points. However, the answer could have delved deeper into the biblical foundation and distinctions between Agape, Philia, and Eros, as well as highlighted the importance of aligning all forms of love with the overarching commandment to love God above all and one's neighbor as oneself. Additionally, emphasizing the sanctity and purpose of marriage in biblical teachings would have enhanced the response. Overall, a solid effort in integrating biblical principles with different forms of love."
