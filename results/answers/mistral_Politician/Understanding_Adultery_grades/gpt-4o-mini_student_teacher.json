  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of what the Bible says about adultery, citing relevant verses from both the Old and New Testaments. They also discussed the consequences of adultery as outlined in Proverbs. However, the student could have further emphasized the relational and spiritual consequences of adultery on marriage and spirituality as the concern specifically asked for. Overall, a strong and well-supported answer from a Christian worldview."
