  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good general explanation of the term \"Amen\" and its significance in various religious traditions. However, it lacks depth in specifically addressing the significance of prayer within the Christian practice, which is the specified concern. To improve the grade, the response could have elaborated more on how \"Amen\" reflects the Christian belief in the power of prayer, the relationship between believers and God through prayer, and the importance of faith expressed through \"Amen\" in Christian worship."
