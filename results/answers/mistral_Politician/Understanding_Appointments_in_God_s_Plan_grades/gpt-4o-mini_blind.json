  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 70.\n\nThe student explains the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context fairly accurately by mentioning the belief in spending eternity in either heaven or hell based on accepting Jesus Christ as savior. They also touch on the predestined or chosen aspect of this belief, which is a point of debate within Christianity. \n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific references from the Bible regarding the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\", such as Acts 13:48 or Ephesians 1:4-5. Additionally, discussing the role of God's sovereignty and election in this context would enrich the explanation.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a decent understanding of the concept but could enhance their answer by delving deeper into scriptural support and theological nuances."
