  "grade_comment": "The student's answer provides a solid explanation of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context, referencing relevant Bible verses and acknowledging the variability of interpretations within Christianity. However, the answer falls short in explicitly addressing the concept of divine selection and grace as per the concern provided. The student should have focused more on the sovereign will and grace of God in the process of being appointed to eternal life.\n\nGrade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but lacks emphasis on the divine selection and grace aspects highlighted in the concern. More clarity on God's role in choosing individuals for eternal life could have improved the answer."
