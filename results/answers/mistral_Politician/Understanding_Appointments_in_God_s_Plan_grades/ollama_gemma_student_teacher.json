  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" within a Christian context. It accurately explains the basic idea of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ and references relevant biblical passages. However, the inclusion of the sentence about varying interpretations among denominations and individuals adds nuance and depth to the response. The student also correctly points out the debate surrounding the concept of predestination."
