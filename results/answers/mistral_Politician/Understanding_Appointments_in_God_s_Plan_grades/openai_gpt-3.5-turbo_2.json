  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by explaining the concept of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation from a Christian worldview. It accurately portrays the idea of being \"appointed to eternal life\" as being chosen by God to receive the gift of eternal life through His sovereign will and grace, aligning well with Christian beliefs on predestination and salvation. The additional information about varying interpretations and ongoing debates within Christianity adds depth to the discussion. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
