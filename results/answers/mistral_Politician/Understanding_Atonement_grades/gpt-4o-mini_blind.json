The answer focuses more on acknowledging the belief rather than delving into the theological implications and biblical basis for Christ's atonement. It also misses discussing the concept of substitutionary atonement, which is a key aspect of Christian understanding regarding Christ's sacrifice. The explanation could be improved by providing more scriptural references and doctrinal insights to enhance the clarity and accuracy of the response."
