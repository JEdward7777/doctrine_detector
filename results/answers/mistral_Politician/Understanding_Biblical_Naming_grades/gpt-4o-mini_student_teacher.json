  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates an understanding of the importance of names in the Bible and how they are used to identify individuals. However, the response could be improved by focusing more directly on the specific question about the meaning of \"His name is called John,\" rather than a general overview of biblical naming conventions. The reference answer provided by the teacher offers a more concise and direct interpretation of the phrase in question."
