  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges that \"His name is called John\" signifies the formal or official name given to an individual, which is correct. However, it only provides a brief and surface-level explanation without delving deeper into the significance of names in Scripture. To fully understand proper biblical interpretation and the significance of names in scripture, one needs to explore the meanings, origins, and potential symbolism associated with these names, as mentioned in the original response. The concern emphasizes the importance of grasping this concept, but the given answer only scratches the surface."
