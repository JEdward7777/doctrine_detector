  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a decent summary of the Biblical account of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob and touches on some key implications for both brothers. The student appropriately highlights Esau's immediate loss of privileges and Jacob's gain through deception. However, the response lacks depth in discussing the spiritual and moral lessons that can be gleaned from this account. The significance of God's sovereignty and the consequences of Esau's worldly mindset could have been explored further. Additionally, the language could have been more reverent towards the biblical narrative."
