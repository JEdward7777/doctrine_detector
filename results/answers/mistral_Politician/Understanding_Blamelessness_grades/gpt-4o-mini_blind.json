The mention of varying interpretations among denominations is also valid. To improve, the answer could have delved deeper into the concept of being made blameless through Christ's righteousness imputed to believers, and the significance of grace in achieving blamelessness before God. Additionally, suggesting consulting religious leaders or scholars is good advice for further clarification on specific beliefs."
