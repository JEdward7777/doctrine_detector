  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComment: The response attempts to navigate a delicate balance between respecting Biblical tradition and addressing contemporary sensitivities, but it falls short in providing a clear and doctrinally correct understanding of how the Biblical definitions of 'clean' and 'unclean' inform our understanding of moral purity. The student's answer lacks depth in exploring the spiritual significance of cleanliness and fails to connect it effectively to moral purity as understood within a Christian worldview. Additionally, the emphasis on inclusivity and modern sensibilities takes precedence over presenting a scripturally sound interpretation. The response would benefit from a more robust engagement with Biblical texts and theological insights to support their points."
