  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a decent overview of the Biblical definitions of 'clean' and 'unclean' and acknowledges their historical significance. However, there is a lack of depth in connecting these definitions to the broader concept of moral purity. The answer could have delved deeper into how understanding the significance of cleanliness in a spiritual context can guide believers in their personal and communal lives, as outlined in the concern. The student's emphasis on respect and inclusivity is commendable but falls short of fully addressing the question from a Christian worldview perspective."
