However, there is room for improvement in specifically addressing the concern raised and connecting the provided Bible verses to highlight this contrast more directly. The response does acknowledge the power of grace to overcome sin, but could deepen the analysis by drawing clearer distinctions between condemnation and grace in relation to the verses mentioned."
