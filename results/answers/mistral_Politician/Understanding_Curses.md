## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician, it's important to promote harmony, respect, and understanding among all individuals. The Bible, particularly James 3:10, emphasizes the potential harm caused by our words, including cursing others:

"Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so." (James 3:10 KJV)

This passage suggests that using our tongue for both blessing and cursing is inappropriate, as it implies a lack of consistency and integrity. It encourages us to exercise self-control and speak kindly and positively about others. By practicing this, we can foster an environment of mutual respect, peace, and unity. This sentiment aligns well with the goals of maintaining political correctness and ensuring that our actions and words don't offend or harm others unnecessarily.
