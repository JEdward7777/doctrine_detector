  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful response that acknowledges the importance of promoting harmony and respect, which align with Christian values. However, there is a lack of direct focus on the spiritual implications and consequences mentioned in James 3:10. The student could have delved deeper into the negative impact of cursing others and the need for aligning our words with God's teachings."
