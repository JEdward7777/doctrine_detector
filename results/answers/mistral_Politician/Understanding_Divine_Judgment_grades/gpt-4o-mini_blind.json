It correctly highlights the source, purpose, and nature of each type of judgment, supported by relevant biblical references. The answer could slightly improve by delving deeper into the concept of God's judgment as an expression of His righteousness and holiness, emphasizing the need for repentance and faith in Christ for reconciliation. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the consequences of human judgment without aligning it with God's standards could enhance the theological reflection. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
