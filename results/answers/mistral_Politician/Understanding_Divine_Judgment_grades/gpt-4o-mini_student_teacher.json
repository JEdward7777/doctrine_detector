  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student provided a solid understanding of the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment from a Christian perspective. They referenced relevant Bible verses to support their points and emphasized the differences in the sources, standards, and purposes of judgment. However, the answer could have been strengthened by directly comparing God's judgment as based on His perfect righteousness and justice, involving both punishment and a call to repentance, as stated in the reference answer. Additionally, highlighting the importance of acknowledging human limitations and striving for justice and compassion in judgment would have further enhanced the response. Overall, a well-written and insightful answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
