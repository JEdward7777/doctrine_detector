  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the distinct differences between God's judgment and human judgment, including their sources, purposes, and natures. The writer provides biblical support for their points and does an excellent job explaining the purpose of God's judgment as reconciliation with Him, rather than punishment.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more explicit in its comparison to the provided answer. While the response mentions the flaws in human judgment, it could further emphasize how God's judgment stands in stark contrast to this flawed human approach. Additionally, a few of the supporting biblical references could be omitted without losing the overall effectiveness of the response.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong and well-organized response that effectively addresses the concern and demonstrates a good understanding of the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment."
