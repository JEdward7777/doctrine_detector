It correctly emphasizes that God's judgment is based on His perfect righteousness and justice, while human judgment can be flawed due to personal biases and imperfect knowledge. The explanation provided is clear and well-supported with relevant biblical references, demonstrating a strong understanding of the distinction between the two forms of judgment. The incorporation of scriptural verses enhances the response's credibility and aligns with Christian teachings on judgment. Overall, a well-rounded and insightful analysis."
