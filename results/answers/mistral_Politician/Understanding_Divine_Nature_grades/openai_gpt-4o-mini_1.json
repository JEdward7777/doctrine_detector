It acknowledges the importance of understanding God's nature for developing a personal relationship and living according to His will. However, the initial response, while broadening the discussion to include various perspectives on divine nature, could be deemed somewhat relativistic from a Christian worldview, as it does not emphasize the foundational truth of God's nature in Christianity."
