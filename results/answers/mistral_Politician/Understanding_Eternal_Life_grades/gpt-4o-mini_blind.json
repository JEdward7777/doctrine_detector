It references relevant scripture verses to support its points. However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the central Christian belief that eternal life is obtained through faith in Jesus Christ alone, as highlighted in John 3:16. Additionally, it could have further expounded on the concept of grace as a key factor in receiving eternal life, as mentioned in Ephesians 2:8-9. Overall, a solid response but could have been more precise in conveying key doctrinal points."
