  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of how various Christian denominations interpret inheriting eternal life from the Bible. They accurately referenced key verses that support the concept of eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the student missed the crucial aspect of obedience to God's laws in inheriting eternal life, which is emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Integrating obedience to God's laws along with faith would have strengthened the student's answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
