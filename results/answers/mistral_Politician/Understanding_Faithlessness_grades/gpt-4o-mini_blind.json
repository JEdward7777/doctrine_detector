  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer misses the mark in providing a Christian worldview perspective on the term \"faithless.\" In Christianity, being \"faithless\" does indeed imply a lack of faith or belief in God. From a doctrinal standpoint, the term \"faithless\" signifies a rejection of God's truth and a failure to trust in Him. The response does not adequately address the theological implications of the term within a Christian context."
