  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the general definition of \"faithless\" as untrustworthy or disloyal. However, it lacks nuance and fails to address the specific concern of the prompt, which is to explain the implications of the term in the context of belief in God. The response would benefit from further elaboration on the relationship between faith and moral conduct in the Christian worldview."
