However, it could be strengthened by emphasizing the Christian perspective that faith plays a crucial role in shaping one's moral conduct, as faith in God provides a foundation for understanding ethical behavior and aligning one's actions with Christian principles. This connection could further highlight the importance of faith in guiding one's behavior and decisions according to Christian beliefs."
