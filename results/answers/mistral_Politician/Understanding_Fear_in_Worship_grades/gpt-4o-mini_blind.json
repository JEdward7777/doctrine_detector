However, it falls short in emphasizing the crucial distinction between worldly fear and biblical fear. The response should have highlighted the transformative aspect of biblical fear, leading to wisdom and obedience rather than just a respectful dialogue. Also, the tone of political correctness could be perceived as avoiding a clear stance on the biblical truth about fear. More clarity on the importance of biblical fear for believers' growth in faith would have strengthened the response."
