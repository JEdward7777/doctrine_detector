  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: The student gave a comprehensive and accurate explanation of forgiveness according to Christian teaching. They correctly highlighted the biblical basis for forgiveness, emphasizing the importance of extending grace and mercy towards others as God has done for us. The student also appropriately mentioned that forgiveness does not necessarily equate to immediate reconciliation, demonstrating an understanding of the complexities involved in the process. While the ending paragraph slightly veers off from the Christian worldview by focusing on political correctness, the overall response aligns well with Christian doctrine on forgiveness."
