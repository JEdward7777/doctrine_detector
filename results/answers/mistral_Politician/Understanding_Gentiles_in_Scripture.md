How did the Israelites' perception of Gentiles affect their relationships with them in the early church?

The Israelites traditionally viewed Gentiles as outsiders who could never be God's people, which led to challenges in relationship and fellowship within the early church as these barriers were being broken down.

## Concern to grade by
This question addresses the historical context of Jewish-Gentile relationships and their implications for the church's unity.

## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the early Christian church, the relationship between the Israelites (Jewish believers) and Gentiles was marked by a complex interplay of cultural traditions, religious beliefs, and newfound faith in Jesus Christ. The Old Testament scriptures, which were foundational to Jewish belief and practice, contained several teachings that could be perceived as negative or divisive towards non-Jews (Gentiles).

For instance, the books of Deuteronomy (7:1-6) and Isaiah (43:20-28) emphasized the chosenness of Israel and the separation between them and other nations. However, in the New Testament, we see a significant shift in this perspective as the gospel message was extended to all people, regardless of ethnicity or nationality.

The Apostle Peter played a pivotal role in bridging the gap between Jews and Gentiles within the early church. In Acts 10, Peter received a vision from God that challenged his traditional understanding of dietary laws and the acceptance of non-Jewish people into the community of believers. This vision was later confirmed by an encounter with Cornelius, a Gentile centurion (Acts 11:1-18).

Similarly, the Apostle Paul, who was initially a Pharisee and strict adherent to Jewish law, became a vocal advocate for the inclusion of Gentiles in the church. In his letters to the Galatians and Romans, he emphasized that faith in Christ is what unites believers, rather than adherence to specific cultural or religious practices (Galatians 3:28; Colossians 3:11).

In summary, while early Israelites may have had a less inclusive view of Gentiles based on their traditional Jewish teachings, the advent of Christianity and the guidance of key figures like Peter and Paul led to a more accepting and welcoming attitude towards non-Jewish people within the church. However, it is important to note that this process was not without challenges and tensions, as we can see in the Book of Acts and the letters of Paul.
