  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-organized answer that effectively discussed the shift in perception towards Gentiles in the early church, highlighting key figures like Peter and Paul. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the historical context and the implications for the church's unity. However, the answer could have been strengthened by directly addressing how the Israelites' traditional view of Gentiles affected their relationships within the early church, as emphasized in the reference answer."
