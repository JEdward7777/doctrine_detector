It correctly highlights the traditional views of Israelites towards Gentiles and how the barriers were being broken down through the teachings and actions of key figures like Peter and Paul. The integration of biblical references and scriptural teachings adds depth to the analysis from a Christian worldview perspective. The only slight room for improvement would be to expand on how these relationships affected the church's unity more explicitly."
