  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the term \"Most High\" and its significance in religious contexts, showcasing an understanding of its implications. However, the student did not directly address the concern regarding believers struggling to comprehend God's sovereignty in their personal lives. Encouraging the student to tie in practical examples or scriptural references to help believers grasp the concept would have strengthened their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
