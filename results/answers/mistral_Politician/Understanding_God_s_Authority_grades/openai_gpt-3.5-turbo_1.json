However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the concern raised about believers struggling to comprehend the implications of God's sovereignty in their personal lives from a Christian perspective. A more direct link between God's title as \"Most High\" and the support and guidance He provides to believers in understanding His sovereignty could have been beneficial."
