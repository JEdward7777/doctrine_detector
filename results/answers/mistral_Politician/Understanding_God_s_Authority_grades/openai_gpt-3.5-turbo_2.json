It acknowledges the traditional understanding of this title and its implications. The concern raised about believers struggling to comprehend the implications of God's sovereignty is valid and aligns well with Christian teachings on the challenges of fully comprehending the depths of God's sovereignty in personal lives. Overall, a strong response that demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective."
