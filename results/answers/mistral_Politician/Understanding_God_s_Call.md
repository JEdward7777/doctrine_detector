## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician, I strive to respect all beliefs and perspectives in our diverse society. When the Bible states that God has called us by name, it is often interpreted as a personal and intimate act of relationship between an individual and their deity. This concept suggests that each person is unique and valued, and that God knows and cares for them deeply on a personal level. The exact meaning can vary among different faiths and interpretations, but the overarching message is one of love, connection, and individual significance in the eyes of the divine.
