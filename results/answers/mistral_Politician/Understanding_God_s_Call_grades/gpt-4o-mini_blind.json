However, it overlooks the specific Christian understanding of being called by name in the Bible. From a Christian worldview, being called by name signifies a deep theological truth about God's personal relationship with His people, emphasizing His knowledge, care, and purpose for each individual. The answer could have been strengthened by delving deeper into this significance within the context of Christian doctrine."
