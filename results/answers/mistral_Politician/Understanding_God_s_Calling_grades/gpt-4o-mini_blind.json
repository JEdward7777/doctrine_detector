The response emphasizes the subjective nature of the belief without delving into the Biblical basis for the concept of divine calling. Additionally, there is a focus on diversity of beliefs within Christianity that somewhat dilutes the specificity of the question. A stronger emphasis on the theological foundation of God's calling, linked to scripture and the discernment of His will, would have strengthened the answer."
