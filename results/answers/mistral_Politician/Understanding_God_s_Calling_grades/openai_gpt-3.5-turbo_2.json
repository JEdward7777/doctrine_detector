It acknowledges the significance of this belief in shaping individuals' religious identity and guiding their actions. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of aligning one's personal purpose with God's will and seeking His guidance in discerning one's calling. It would have been beneficial to include more explicitly Christian references or teachings to strengthen the Christian perspective on understanding personal purpose in the context of faith."
