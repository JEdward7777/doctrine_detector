  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as a 80.\n\nWhile the student provided comprehensive examples of how Jesus demonstrated favor with God and men according to the Bible, there was a slight deviation from the concern provided. The student focused more on recounting specific actions and teachings of Jesus rather than emphasizing the character traits that led to Him being favored by God and others. The reference provided by the teacher centered on the character and behavior of Jesus, which the student did not specifically address in their response. Encouraging the student to focus more on the underlying character qualities that Jesus exhibited would have strengthened their answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
