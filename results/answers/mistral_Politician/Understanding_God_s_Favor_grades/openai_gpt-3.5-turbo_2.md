 According to the New Testament in the Bible, Jesus demonstrated favor with God and men in several ways:

1. Living a sinless life (Matthew 3:15, Hebrews 4:15): Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, and was obedient to God's will at all times. He set an example for us to follow in this regard.

2. Teaching with authority (Matthew 7:28-29): Jesus taught with wisdom, grace, and authority. His teachings were not like the scribes who taught based on human tradition, but with divine authority.

3. Performing miracles (John 5:36): Jesus performed numerous miracles, demonstrating his divine power and compassion towards those in need. These miracles included healing the sick, casting out demons, and even raising the dead.

4. Demonstrating love for all people (John 13:34-35): Jesus showed love for all people, regardless of their status or background. He reached out to the marginalized, the sinners, the lepers, and even his enemies. His teachings emphasized love, forgiveness, and humility.

5. Dying on the cross for the sins of mankind (Romans 5:8): The ultimate demonstration of favor with God was Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. He willingly gave up his life to atone for the sins of humanity. This act of love and obedience showed his deep respect for God's will and demonstrated His love for all mankind.

6. Resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:3-4): Jesus' resurrection confirmed his divinity, fulfilled prophecies, and demonstrated God's power over death. It was a symbol of hope for those who believe in him.

In conclusion, Jesus demonstrated favor with God by living a sinless life, teaching with authority, performing miracles, showing love towards all people, dying on the cross for the sins of mankind, and resurrecting from the dead. His actions and teachings continue to inspire millions around the world today.
