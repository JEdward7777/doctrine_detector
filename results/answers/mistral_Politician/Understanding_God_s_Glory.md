## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician, I am here to facilitate dialogue and promote understanding, rather than to express personal beliefs or interpret religious texts. However, I can help outline the difference between the concept of God's glory as described in the Bible and worldly sources of glory based on public discourse:

1. Sources of worldly glory often revolve around human accomplishments, recognition, status, power, wealth, beauty, or talent. These are transient, dependent on external factors, and subject to the whims of society.

2. The concept of God's glory in the Bible is associated with divine attributes, such as love, justice, wisdom, and holiness. It transcends temporal human concerns and reflects God's nature and character. In Exodus 16:7 (NIV), it says that "the Lord is the one who will give you bread and wine and oil to drink; but He will put none in your mouth but just enough." This suggests a different, more meaningful quality of provision than worldly glory.

3. Worldly glory often focuses on self-aggrandizement, seeking personal gain or recognition. The pursuit of God's glory encourages humility and service to others. In Matthew 6:1 (NIV), Jesus says, "Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them."

4. Worldly glory can lead to conflict and divisiveness as people compete for recognition or power. The pursuit of God's glory fosters unity, empathy, and a focus on the common good, as seen in passages like John 13:35 (NIV), "By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."

5. Worldly glory is temporary and fleeting, whereas God's glory is eternal. In Romans 2:7 (NIV), it says that "to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life."

In essence, the pursuit of worldly glory is focused on human achievements, often with selfish motivations. The concept of God's glory in the Bible emphasizes selfless service, humility, unity, and an eternal connection to something greater than ourselves.
