  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough comparison between God's glory as described in the Bible and worldly sources of glory, highlighting the importance of God's glory being immeasurably superior. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the need to understand the unique and supreme nature of God's glory for proper worship.

However, the response could be enhanced by directly integrating the provided answer into the explanation for a more cohesive presentation."
