However, from a Christian worldview, seeking God's will involves more than just using faith as a compass for personal decision-making based on moral principles. It should also involve surrendering one's own will to God's sovereign and perfect will, seeking guidance through prayer, Scripture, and the Holy Spirit. This answer lacks a clear emphasis on aligning personal desires with God's revealed truth and submitting to His authority. Additionally, it falls short in highlighting the importance of seeking God's will in all aspects of life, not just private decisions but also public responsibilities and policies."
