  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's answer acknowledges the importance of seeking God's will in decision-making and respecting diverse religious beliefs, there is a lack of emphasis on the foundational aspect of aligning decisions with God's desires as revealed in Scripture. The response focuses more on personal interpretation and individual beliefs rather than the ultimate authority of God's Word in guiding our actions. Encouraging a deeper understanding of seeking God's will through Biblical alignment would strengthen the student's answer from a Christian perspective."
