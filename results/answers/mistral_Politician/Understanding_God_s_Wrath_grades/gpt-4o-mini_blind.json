  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The response provides a good overview of the nature of God's wrath and how it differs from human anger. The student correctly emphasizes God's righteousness and holiness as the root of His wrath, and highlights the eternal aspect of God's wrath compared to the transient nature of human anger. However, the answer could have been stronger by including more specific references to biblical passages that illustrate God's wrath and by emphasizing the importance of repentance and redemption in understanding God's wrath. Additionally, while the inclusion of inclusivity and respect in discussions is commendable, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of God's wrath for humanity."
