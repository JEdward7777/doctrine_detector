  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thoughtful exploration of the nature of God's wrath and its distinction from human anger, incorporating elements of biblical teachings and reflection. However, the response could have been more focused on directly addressing the concern provided and referencing specific biblical passages to support the points made. Additionally, the emphasis on creating a harmonious community, while important, somewhat detracts from the central theme of God's wrath as a measured response to sin. Overall, the answer shows effort and understanding, but could benefit from greater alignment with the specified concern and a deeper engagement with the biblical perspective on God's wrath."
