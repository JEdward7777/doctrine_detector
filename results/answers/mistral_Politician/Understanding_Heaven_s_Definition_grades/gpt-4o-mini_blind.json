  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 70. \n\nThe student provided a clear explanation differentiating between the biblical understanding of \"heaven\" and the concept of \"sky.\" They correctly highlighted the Christian theology surrounding heaven as the abode of God and the destination for righteous souls, as well as emphasized the spiritual nature of heaven transcending physical constraints. The distinction made between \"heaven\" and \"sky\" was well articulated.\n\nHowever, the answer falls short in explicitly stating the biblical definition of \"heaven,\" which is an essential component of the question. Additionally, the response could have benefited from a stronger connection to specific biblical passages or teachings regarding heaven. Overall, while the student demonstrated an understanding of the concepts involved, more depth and specificity rooted in biblical teachings would have enhanced the answer."
