  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a solid understanding of the common Christian interpretations of 'heaven' and 'sky,' acknowledging the spiritual aspects of heaven and the physical nature of the sky. However, the answer could have been improved by directly referencing the biblical definition of heaven as the abode of God and distinguishing it more clearly from the sky as described in Scripture. Overall, the student demonstrated a good grasp of the theological concepts but could have delved deeper into the biblical context."
