They accurately mention biblical references such as Galatians 3:29 and Ephesians 2:19-22 to support their explanation. However, the use of being a politician and emphasizing inclusivity may dilute the doctrinal correctness needed in a Christian response. A more direct focus on the biblical teachings without the need for delicacy or inclusivity would have further strengthened the answer."
