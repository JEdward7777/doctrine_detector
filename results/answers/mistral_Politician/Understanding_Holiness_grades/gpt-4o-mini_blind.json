However, the answer lacks specificity in terms of Christian doctrine and fails to delve deeply into the significance of God's holiness in shaping our relationship with Him according to Biblical teachings. It would have been more effective if the student had highlighted key Biblical passages or theological explanations to support their points. Additionally, the language used could have been more explicitly rooted in Christian theology rather than a broad, inclusive perspective."
