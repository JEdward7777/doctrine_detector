  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of God's holiness and its implications on human behavior but lacks a crucial Christian worldview perspective on the sinfulness of humanity and the need for God's allowance for us to approach Him. The response does not adequately address the concern regarding our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God from a Christian standpoint. There is room for improvement in aligning the response more closely with a Christian-specific worldview on God's holiness and its impact on our relationship with Him."
