It is important to highlight the significance of Christ's sacrifice and the process of sanctification in understanding how we can approach a holy God despite our sinful nature. Additionally, a clearer connection to the necessary steps for personal transformation and spiritual growth would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
