However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern raised about the reflection on personal holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God. While the response acknowledges the importance of striving towards moral and virtuous lives, it does not emphasize the profound impact of recognizing our own sinfulness in light of God's holiness and the need for reconciliation through Christ. A more explicit connection to the need for repentance and reliance on God's grace for approaching Him in holiness would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
