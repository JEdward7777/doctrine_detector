It acknowledges the idea that God's holiness sets Him apart from sin and emphasizes the need for His allowance for us to approach Him. However, it could have delved deeper into the significance of our own holiness and the steps required for approaching a holy God from a Christian worldview perspective. The response could have also integrated more explicitly Christian terminology and scriptures to strengthen its alignment with a Christian specific worldview."
