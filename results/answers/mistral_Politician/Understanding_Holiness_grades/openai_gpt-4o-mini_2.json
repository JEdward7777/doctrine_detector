  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the concept of God's absolute holiness and its implications on human nature, it falls short in addressing the concern directly. The response focuses more on a general overview of the concept rather than delving into the specific reflection on personal holiness and the approach to a holy God as prompted by the concern. It lacks depth and specificity in connecting the provided answer with the concern, resulting in a lower grade."
