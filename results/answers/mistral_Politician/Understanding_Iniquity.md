## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a helpful and respectful guide, I will provide a brief explanation of these terms based on their biblical context:

1. Iniquity (Hebrew: עָוֶל, 'awwēl; Greek: ανομία anomia): This term refers to moral perverseness or wickedness in behavior and character that departs from the standard of righteousness. It is often used to describe a state of moral corruption or depravity.

2. Sin (Hebrew: חַטָּאת, chetăʿāw; Greek: ἁμαρτία hamartia): Sin is an act of transgression against God's law. It is a violation of divine will or standard that results in separation from God and spiritual death. This term emphasizes the individual's responsibility for their actions.

3. Transgression (Hebrew: פֶשַׁע, pēšaʿ; Greek: πλάνη planē): Transgression refers to a deliberate act of disobedience or rebellion against God's commands. It emphasizes the active nature of sinful behavior and the rejection of God's authority.

These terms are related, as they all describe various aspects of moral wrongdoing in the Bible. However, using them appropriately helps to convey specific nuances that can aid in understanding and addressing ethical issues with sensitivity and accuracy.
