  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 95.\n\nThis response accurately summarizes the biblical definitions of iniquity, sin, and transgression, providing clear examples from Hebrew and Greek texts. The explanation is thorough and well-structured, making it easy to follow and understand. The connection between these terms is also made explicit, highlighting their relatedness but distinct nuances.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more explicitly tied to the concern of understanding the gravity of one's actions and seeking repentance. While this is implied in the explanation, a more direct connection would strengthen the overall response.\n\nWell done!"
