## Question [Understanding Iniquity](../../../questions/Understanding_Iniquity.md)
What is the biblical distinction between iniquity, sin, and transgression?

## Correct Answer
Iniquity refers more specifically to deliberate acts of wrongdoing or great wickedness, while sin encompasses a broader range of moral failings, and transgression involves violating a command or law.

## Stated Concern
Understanding these distinctions can help Christians better recognize the gravity of their actions and seek repentance.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Iniquity.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a helpful and respectful guide, I will provide a brief explanation of these terms based on their biblical context:

1. Iniquity (Hebrew: עָוֶל, 'awwēl; Greek: ανομία anomia): This term refers to moral perverseness or wickedness in behavior and character that departs from the standard of righteousness. It is often used to describe a state of moral corruption or depravity.

2. Sin (Hebrew: חַטָּאת, chetăʿāw; Greek: ἁμαρτία hamartia): Sin is an act of transgression against God's law. It is a violation of divine will or standard that results in separation from God and spiritual death. This term emphasizes the individual's responsibility for their actions.

3. Transgression (Hebrew: פֶשַׁע, pēšaʿ; Greek: πλάνη planē): Transgression refers to a deliberate act of disobedience or rebellion against God's commands. It emphasizes the active nature of sinful behavior and the rejection of God's authority.

These terms are related, as they all describe various aspects of moral wrongdoing in the Bible. However, using them appropriately helps to convey specific nuances that can aid in understanding and addressing ethical issues with sensitivity and accuracy.
