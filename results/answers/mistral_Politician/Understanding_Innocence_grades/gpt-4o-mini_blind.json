The inclusion of relevant Scripture passages from both the Old Testament and the New Testament helps support the explanation given. The emphasis on justice, righteousness, and the importance of treating others fairly aligns well with biblical principles. However, the response could be further strengthened by delving deeper into the theological significance of innocence within the framework of redemption and the atonement provided by Christ."
