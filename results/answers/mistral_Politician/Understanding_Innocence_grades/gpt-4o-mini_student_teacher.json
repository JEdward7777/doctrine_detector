  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concept of innocence in relation to being wrongfully accused. They correctly reference relevant biblical passages and highlight the importance of justice, righteousness, forgiveness, and compassion in Christian teachings. One improvement could be to provide more direct and concise explanations without straying too far from the core biblical message on innocence. Overall, a strong and well-supported response."
