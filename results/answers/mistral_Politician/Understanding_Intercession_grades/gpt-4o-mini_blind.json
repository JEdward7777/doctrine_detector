However, the statement about political correctness and inclusivity at the end could be misleading in a theological discussion. It is important to prioritize doctrinal correctness over secular concepts like political correctness and inclusivity. A more focused conclusion on the biblical teachings about the Holy Spirit's role in intercession would have strengthened the response."
