  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession based on biblical references. They correctly highlighted the Holy Spirit's intercessory work on behalf of believers and how it aligns with God's will. However, the inclusion of the politically correct statement detracted from the clarity and focus on the biblical perspective. Overall, a good understanding with room for improvement in maintaining a clear Christian worldview."
