  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the term \"Lord\" in the Christian tradition, encompassing references in both the Old and New Testaments. However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing the ownership and authority aspects of the term 'Lord' more explicitly when discussing Jesus. The student correctly highlighted the divine nature and authority associated with the term but could have delved deeper into how it signifies Jesus as God."
