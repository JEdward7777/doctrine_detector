  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80/100\n\nComment: The student has provided a generally sound explanation of the term 'majesty' in relation to God's character within religious contexts. They correctly highlight the concepts of greatness, grandeur, supremacy, reverence, awe, and respect. However, the response could be enhanced by incorporating specific Christian doctrinal references or Biblical verses to support the explanation further. Additionally, emphasizing the transcendence and holiness of God more prominently would strengthen the overall theological depth of the answer."
