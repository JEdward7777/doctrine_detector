  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90. The student effectively conveys the significance of the term 'majesty' in relation to God's character, emphasizing reverence, awe, and respect for God's greatness. They also touch on the idea of God's supremacy over creation. The student's answer aligns well with a Christian worldview by acknowledging God's transcendent qualities. The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of God's attributes and sovereignty over creation, which was the specified concern."
