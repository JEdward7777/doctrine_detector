However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to explicitly anchor mercy in the context of God's merciful nature and sacrifice through Jesus Christ. The answer could be strengthened by including references to biblical examples of mercy and how Jesus exemplified mercy in His interactions with others. Additionally, emphasizing the role of prayer and seeking God's guidance in showing mercy would further align the response with Christian beliefs."
