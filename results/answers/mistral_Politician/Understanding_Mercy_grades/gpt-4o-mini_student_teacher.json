  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive list of practical ways to demonstrate mercy in daily life, aligning with the concern of embodying God's merciful nature. However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on the foundational principles of kindness, forgiveness, and helping those in need as exemplified by God. While the student's suggestions are valuable, a stronger connection to the reference answer, emphasizing these core aspects of mercy, would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
