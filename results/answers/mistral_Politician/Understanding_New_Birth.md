## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 According to the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, being "born again" refers to spiritual rebirth or regeneration. In John 3:3, Jesus explains this concept to a Pharisee named Nicodemus by saying, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."

This idea is further explained in other passages like John 3:5-8 where Jesus tells Nicodemus that a person must be born of water and the Spirit. This symbolizes physical birth (water) and spiritual rebirth (Spirit). The "born again" experience is often associated with repentance, faith in Christ as savior, and receiving the gift of eternal life. It's important to note that interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations, and the specifics can depend on personal beliefs and theological perspectives.
