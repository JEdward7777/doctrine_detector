## Question [Understanding New Birth](../../../questions/Understanding_New_Birth.md)
What does it mean to be 'born again' according to the Bible?

## Correct Answer
Being 'born again' refers to the spiritual transformation that occurs when a person accepts Jesus Christ as their Savior, moving from spiritual deadness to spiritual life.

## Stated Concern
This question addresses the foundational aspect of Christian faith, which is the understanding of spiritual rebirth.

## [Answer](../Understanding_New_Birth.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 According to the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, being "born again" refers to spiritual rebirth or regeneration. In John 3:3, Jesus explains this concept to a Pharisee named Nicodemus by saying, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."

This idea is further explained in other passages like John 3:5-8 where Jesus tells Nicodemus that a person must be born of water and the Spirit. This symbolizes physical birth (water) and spiritual rebirth (Spirit). The "born again" experience is often associated with repentance, faith in Christ as savior, and receiving the gift of eternal life. It's important to note that interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations, and the specifics can depend on personal beliefs and theological perspectives.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a solid explanation of being "born again" according to the Bible, focusing on the spiritual rebirth and regeneration aspect supported by the interaction between Jesus and Nicodemus in John 3. The mention of repentance, faith in Christ, and receiving eternal life aligns well with Christian doctrine. The only slight improvement could be to emphasize more the necessity of faith in Jesus Christ as the foundational aspect of being "born again." Overall, a well-explained and doctrinally sound response.
