  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a strong understanding of the concept of perishing in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament, mentioning separation from God and eternal damnation due to living contrary to God's teachings. The answer could be improved by directly referencing the importance of trusting in Jesus for salvation, as highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, the mention of respecting diversity in interpretation is commendable but slightly detracts from the focus on the specific Christian concept being explored. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
