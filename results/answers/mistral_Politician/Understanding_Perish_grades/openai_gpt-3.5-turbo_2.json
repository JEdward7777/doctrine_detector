The expansion on how this separation relates to living contrary to God's teachings adds depth to the explanation. The response acknowledges the diversity of interpretations within Christianity and offers further clarification if needed, demonstrating sensitivity and openness to different perspectives. Overall, a well-rounded and thoughtful response from a Christian worldview."
