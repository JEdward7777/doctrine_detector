  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of purification in the context of the Old Testament, their answer goes beyond the scope of ritual purification and also discusses broader themes such as maintaining a relationship with God, adhering to laws, and the covenant with God. The teacher's reference answer focuses more on the practical aspects of purification from ritual uncleanness and sin through animal sacrifices, which is the specific concern mentioned.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of purification in the Old Testament, but could have focused more narrowly on the aspect of ritual uncleanness and sin as the teacher's concern specified."
