It effectively connects the process of ritual purification to God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin, emphasizing the need for repentance and atonement. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly mention the role of these rituals in demonstrating reverence for God's holiness and acknowledging the seriousness of sin, further solidifying the connection to God's standards for holiness."
