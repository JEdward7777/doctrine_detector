  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a decent explanation of the term \"Lamb of God\" and its significance in both the Old Testament sacrificial system and in Christianity. However, the response falls short in clearly connecting Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin, as emphasized in the reference answer. Additionally, the student's focus on inclusivity and diverse interpretations detracts from fully grasping the Christian worldview that emphasizes Jesus as the unique and perfect sacrifice for redemption. There is a need for a more explicit alignment with the specific Christian belief regarding the sacrificial role of Jesus."
