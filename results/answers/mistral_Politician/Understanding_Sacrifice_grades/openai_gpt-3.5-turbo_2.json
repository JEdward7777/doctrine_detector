It effectively connects the symbolism of the title to the Old Testament sacrificial system and explains the theological implications of Jesus being the ultimate sacrifice for sin. The response respects the Christian perspective and does well to emphasize the importance of recognizing diverse interpretations within Christianity while still presenting a cohesive understanding of the topic."
