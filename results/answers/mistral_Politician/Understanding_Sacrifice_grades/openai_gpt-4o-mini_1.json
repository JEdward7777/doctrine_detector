It correctly connects the sacrificial system in the Old Testament with Jesus being the ultimate, unblemished sacrifice for human sins. The answer acknowledges the significance of this title within Christianity and the symbolic meaning it holds for believers. However, the response could have emphasized more explicitly the unique Christian belief that Jesus is the fulfillment of the sacrificial system, ordained by God for the redemption of humanity."
