However, it could have been improved by emphasizing the Christian understanding and usage of 'Shaddai' within the context of the Old Testament, connecting it to the character of God revealed in Scripture. Additionally, a more explicit reference to God as described in the Bible could enhance the doctrinal correctness. Nevertheless, the response maintains a respectful tone towards the topic."
