The inclusion of invoking Shaddai in times of need was a good addition. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to include the possible meanings of 'Shaddai' such as 'mountain' or 'mountain range' as suggested in the reference answer to further enhance the depth of their explanation from a Christian worldview perspective."
