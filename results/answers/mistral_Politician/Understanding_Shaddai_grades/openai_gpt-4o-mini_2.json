  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provided a clear and accurate explanation of the term 'Shaddai' as a name for God in the Old Testament, highlighting its meaning and significance. The explanation aligns well with the understanding of God's attributes as revealed in Scripture, emphasizing God's omnipotence and presence. However, to improve the grade, a deeper exploration of how the attribute of being \"Almighty\" reflects God's nature and character as revealed in Scripture could have been included."
