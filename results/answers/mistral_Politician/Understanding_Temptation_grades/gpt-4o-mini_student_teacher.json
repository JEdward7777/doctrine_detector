  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the strategies Jesus used to resist temptations. The student effectively applied these strategies to modern contexts and emphasized the importance of self-control, resilience, and moral integrity. However, the student's answer lacked a direct focus on Jesus' use of scripture and unwavering faith in God as the primary strategies to combat temptation, which was the main point of the reference answer. This deviation slightly detracts from the Christian worldview perspective on combating temptation as a follower of Christ."
