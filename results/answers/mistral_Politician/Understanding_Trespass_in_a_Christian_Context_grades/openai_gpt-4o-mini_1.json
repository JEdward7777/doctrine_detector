  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the concepts of trespass and sin in a Christian worldview, acknowledging the violation of both human relationships and God's moral laws. It addresses the concern by highlighting how all sins are considered trespasses against God, thus demonstrating a solid understanding of Christian ethics. The response could be further improved by incorporating more specific biblical references to strengthen the argument and deepen the theological analysis. Additionally, a clearer explanation of how interpersonal violations relate to sin against God would enhance the response. Overall, well done in integrating the Christian perspective into the discussion."
