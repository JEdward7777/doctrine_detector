  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the concept of trespass and sin within a Christian worldview, establishing their shared foundation of transgressing boundaries. The explanation highlights the significance of sins against God as ultimate trespasses. The distinction between legal penalties for trespassing and spiritual consequences for sinning is well-addressed. The response could further deepen the theological implications of these concepts and their ethical implications in Christian life, but overall, it provides a solid understanding of the relationship between interpersonal violations and sin against God in Christian ethics."
