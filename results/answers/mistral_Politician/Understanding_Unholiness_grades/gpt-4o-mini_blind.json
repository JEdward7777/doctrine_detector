However, from a Christian worldview, it is essential to recognize that the definition of \"unholy\" is not solely subjective or culturally determined, but rather grounded in the objective moral standards established by God. The answer correctly identifies various actions and societal behaviors that are considered morally wrong, such as lack of respect for human dignity, immoral behavior, and promotion of greed. However, it fails to emphasize the foundational aspect of sinfulness and separation from God as the core characteristics of an \"unholy\" life. Additionally, the response lacks a clear link to the Christian understanding of sin and the need for redemption through Christ."
