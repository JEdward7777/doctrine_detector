  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a secular perspective on identifying characteristics of an 'unholy' life, focusing on moral principles and societal behaviors. However, it does not address the Christian-specific worldview of rebellion against God, dishonoring Him, and not being set apart for His glory. The answer lacks the foundational understanding of sin and separation from God, which are crucial elements in defining 'unholy' living from a Christian perspective."
