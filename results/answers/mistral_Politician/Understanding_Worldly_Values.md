## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In Christian teachings, the term "worldly" often refers to behaviors or values that are overly focused on material things, earthly success, fame, pleasure, or status, as opposed to spiritual matters. It's important to note that this is not a blanket condemnation of worldly pursuits, but rather a call for balance. The Bible encourages stewardship and hard work, but warns against excessive concern for these things at the expense of one's relationship with God and others.

In the context of Christian teachings, a "worldly" person might be seen as valuing temporary or material things more than eternal or spiritual values, such as love, faith, and righteousness. This is not to say that they are inherently bad, but rather that their priorities may be misaligned.

However, interpretations can vary among different Christian denominations and individuals, so it's always important to consider the specific context and beliefs of the person or group using this term.
