  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"worldly\" according to Christian teachings, emphasizing the balance needed between material pursuits and spiritual values. However, the student's answer lacks a clear alignment with the specified concern that highlights the contrast between worldly values and godly principles. The reference answer focuses on the evil values and behaviors associated with being worldly, which the student did not directly address. The answer could be improved by integrating a more explicit comparison between worldly values and godly principles as outlined in the concern provided."
