The answer provided is overly broad and negative, implying that anything related to the world is inherently evil. This misconception can lead to a misunderstanding of the contrast between worldly values and godly principles.\n\nIn particular, the response does not consider the possibility that some worldly pursuits can be redeemed or used for God's glory, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3:19-23. Additionally, it does not explore the nuances of Christian teachings on the subject, such as the idea that Christians are called to be salt and light in the world (Matthew 5:13-14).\n\nTo better address the concern, a more balanced and nuanced understanding of the term \"worldly\" is needed, one that acknowledges both its potential pitfalls and its opportunities for redemption."
