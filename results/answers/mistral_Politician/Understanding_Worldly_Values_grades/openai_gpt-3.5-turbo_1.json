It acknowledges the importance of stewardship and hard work while cautioning against prioritizing material things over one's relationship with God and others. The response effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the contrast between worldly values, characterized by selfishness and corruption, and godly principles like love, faith, and righteousness. The inclusion of different interpretations among Christian denominations and individuals further demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the topic."
