  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response, while respectful of diverse beliefs and values, does not address the Christian perspective on worship as the relationship with God. In a Christian worldview, worship is specifically focused on honoring and praising God, not just any deity or principle. The answer is well-articulated, but it lacks the foundational understanding of worship within the context of Christianity."
