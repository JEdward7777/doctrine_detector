  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the general definition of worship but does not grasp the specific focus on honoring and obeying God in the Christian faith. It does emphasize respect for different beliefs, which is positive, but misses the Christian perspective on the centrality of worship in relationship with God. More understanding of the Christian worldview is needed for a higher grade."
