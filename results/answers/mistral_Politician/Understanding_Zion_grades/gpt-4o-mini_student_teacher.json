  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a general overview of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" but fails to address the deeper spiritual significance within a Christian worldview. The answer lacks theological depth and does not emphasize the importance of this term in reflecting God's relationship with His chosen people. In a Christian-specific context, it is crucial to highlight the divine love, protection, and covenantal aspects associated with the term 'Daughter of Zion.' The student also missed an opportunity to explore how this metaphor points to the future fulfillment in Christ for believers."
