## Question [Understanding of Sheol and Hades](../../questions/Understanding_of_Sheol_and_Hades.md)
How do the concepts of Sheol and Hades differ in the context of the Bible, especially in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous?

## Target answer from notes
In biblical context, Sheol and Hades refer to a place of the dead but were understood differently over time. Initially, both represented a neutral place where all the dead awaited judgment. However, in the New Testament, Hades becomes associated primarily with the unrighteous, contrasting with 'Abraham's side' or 'paradise' for the righteous.

## Concern to grade by
Understanding the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death.

## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or biases, but I can help explain the historical understanding of these terms in the Bible.

Sheol and Hades are often translated as "the grave" or "the underworld" in English Bibles. Both are ancient Near Eastern concepts that appear in the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) and New Testament. They are not exactly equivalent but share some similarities.

Sheol is mentioned more frequently in the Old Testament, particularly in texts dating from the monarchical period of Israel's history. It was generally understood as the commonplace for all the dead, regardless of their righteousness or wickedness, to dwell in a state of unconsciousness and shadowy existence.

Hades, on the other hand, is more associated with the New Testament and appears primarily in the Gospels. In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible), Sheol is often translated as Hades. However, when Jesus speaks about Hades in the New Testament, it seems to carry a different connotation. For instance, in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31), Hades is described as having two compartments, one for the righteous and one for the unrighteous.

In summary, while both Sheol and Hades are often translated as "the grave" or "the underworld," they may have been understood differently in their original contexts. The concept of Sheol seems to imply a general, unconscious afterlife for all, whereas the New Testament's depiction of Hades suggests a separation between the righteous and unrighteous. However, these are historical interpretations and modern understandings can vary significantly.
