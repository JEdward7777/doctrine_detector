The student accurately distinguishes between the historical understanding of these terms in the Old and New Testaments. However, from a Christian worldview, it would have been beneficial for the student to delve more deeply into the doctrinal implications of Sheol and Hades, particularly in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous. Additionally, the response could have connected these concepts more explicitly to Christian beliefs about judgment, resurrection, and the final destination of souls."
