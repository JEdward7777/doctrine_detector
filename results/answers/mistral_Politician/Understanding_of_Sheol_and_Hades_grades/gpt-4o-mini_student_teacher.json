  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 75.\n\nWhile the student accurately explained the historical understanding of Sheol and Hades in the Bible, and correctly noted the differences in how they are portrayed in the Old and New Testaments, their answer lacks a clear focus on the distinction between the fates of the righteous and unrighteous after death, which was the specified concern. The student provides a good overview of the concepts but could have delved deeper into how the afterlife of the righteous and unrighteous is depicted within Sheol and Hades respectively, as outlined in the reference answer from the teacher."
