  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the historical understanding of Sheol and Hades in the Bible, highlighting the distinction between the fates of the righteous and unrighteous after death. It aligns well with the concern raised and offers additional insights into how these concepts evolved over time within a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the interpretations provided to the biblical teachings on the judgement of the righteous and unrighteous after death."
