## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 As a politician committed to inclusivity, I would say that Jesus Christ, in the context of an Assembly of believers, serves as a symbolic foundation or cornerstone, embodying values such as love, compassion, and unity. His teachings often serve as a moral compass and source of inspiration for many individuals within this community, helping to foster mutual respect, understanding, and support among its members. It's important to remember that the Assembly is diverse and consists of people from various backgrounds, so it's essential to ensure that everyone feels welcome and included, rather than focusing on any specific individual or symbol.
