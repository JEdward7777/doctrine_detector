It fails to acknowledge Jesus as the foundational and central figure upon which the entirety of the Christian faith and the Church is built. The focus on inclusivity and diversity, while important in certain contexts, detracts from the fundamental Christian belief in Jesus Christ as the cornerstone of the spiritual building that is the Church. The answer needed to emphasize the unique role of Jesus as the cornerstone in uniting believers and providing the foundation for faith, rather than focusing solely on symbolic or political interpretations."
