  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 80. \n\nThe student provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of \"the elect\" or \"chosen ones\" according to the Bible, referencing both the Old and New Testaments. They also correctly mentioned that being chosen by God does not imply superiority over others but rather a special relationship with God. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning the aspect of being set apart for holiness and bearing good spiritual fruit, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Incorporating this aspect would have enhanced the overall completeness and clarity of their response."
