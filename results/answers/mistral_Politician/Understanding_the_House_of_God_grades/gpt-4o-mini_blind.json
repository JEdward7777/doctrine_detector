  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 65. \n\nWhile the answer provides a general understanding of the term \"House of God\" in a biblical context, it lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian perspective. The answer correctly mentions the physical places of worship like Solomon's Temple but does not delve deeply into the significance of the term in the New Testament context, where believers themselves are referred to as the temple of God (1 Corinthians 6:19). \n\nAdditionally, the suggestion to use a more inclusive language dilutes the specific Christian understanding of the term 'House of God,' which is vital when discussing biblical concepts. It is essential to maintain doctrinal clarity, especially in a Christian-specific context. This answer could improve by emphasizing the spiritual aspect of believers as the temple of God and the community of believers rather than focusing solely on physical places of worship."
