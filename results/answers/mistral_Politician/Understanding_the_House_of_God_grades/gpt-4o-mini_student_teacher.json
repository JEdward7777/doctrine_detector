  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80. The student correctly identifies that the phrase \"House of God\" in a biblical context refers to a physical place dedicated to worshiping God or where His presence is believed to dwell, such as the tabernacle or temple. They also mention the symbolic interpretation of the term to represent the community of believers as the spiritual temple of God. However, the student veers off a bit by suggesting that interpretations may vary based on religious beliefs and denominations, which could potentially dilute the specific biblical meaning of the term. The reference answer provides a more focused and precise definition of the term."
