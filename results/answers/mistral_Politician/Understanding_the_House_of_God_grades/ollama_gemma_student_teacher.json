They also acknowledge the broader application of the term to the community of believers. However, the answer could benefit from additional elaboration on the symbolic significance of the \"House of God\" as a representation of God's presence among his people. Additionally, the inclusion of a brief explanation about variations in interpretation across denominations would enhance the overall completeness of the response."
