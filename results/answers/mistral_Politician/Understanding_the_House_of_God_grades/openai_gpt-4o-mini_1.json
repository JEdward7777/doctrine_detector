  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the significance and meaning of \"House of God\" in Scripture, specifically relating to the tabernacle or the temple. It demonstrates a sound understanding of the concept within the biblical context. The reference to 1 Peter 2:5 adds depth to the explanation by highlighting the spiritual aspect of the 'House of God'. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more specific biblical references to support the explanation further."
