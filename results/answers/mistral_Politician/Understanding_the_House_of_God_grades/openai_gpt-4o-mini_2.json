  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the biblical concept of the \"House of God,\" incorporating both the physical structures like the tabernacle or temple and the metaphorical understanding of believers as God's spiritual temple. The reference to 1 Peter 2:5 adds depth to the explanation. The inclusion of the consideration for variations in interpretations based on religious beliefs and denominations shows respect and understanding for differing viewpoints while still maintaining a Christian perspective. The suggested inclusive phrase at the end is a good addition, promoting understanding and unity among different religious traditions."
