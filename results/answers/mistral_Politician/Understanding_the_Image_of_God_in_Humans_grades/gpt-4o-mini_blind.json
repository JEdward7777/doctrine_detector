  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: While the response explores various interpretations of the characteristics that reflect the image of God in humans, it lacks a direct integration of the biblical perspective on this matter. The mention of differing interpretations is acknowledged, but a clearer connection to the fundamental biblical teachings would strengthen the response. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, it is essential to emphasize the theological significance of being created in the image of God and its implications for understanding human nature and purpose. Further depth and alignment with biblical principles would enhance the overall grade."
