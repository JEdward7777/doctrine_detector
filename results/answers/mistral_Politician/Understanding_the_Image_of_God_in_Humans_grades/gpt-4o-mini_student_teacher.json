  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and respectful answer by presenting various interpretations of the biblical definition of the image of God in humans. However, from a Christian perspective, key aspects like the eternal spirit of humans and the emphasis on emotions were not highlighted in the student's response. Additionally, the student's neutral stance limited the depth of insight that could have been provided from a Christian worldview. Overall, while the answer was well-researched and inclusive, it lacked specific emphasis on core Christian beliefs related to the image of God in humans."
