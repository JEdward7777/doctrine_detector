  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the term \"Kingdom of God\" in the New Testament, emphasizing themes of love, justice, peace, and righteousness. However, there is a lack of explicit connection to understanding God's sovereignty and authority in our lives as the concern specified. The student touches on the ethical framework for living and building a more just world, but could enhance the response by directly linking this concept to God's sovereignty and authority in guiding individuals and society."
