  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a fairly comprehensive explanation of the concept of \"last days\" in Christian theology, discussing various interpretations and emphasizing the importance of living faithfully and sharing the message of salvation. However, the student's answer does not clearly align with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which specifically states that the 'last days' begin with Jesus' first coming and end with His second coming and the final judgment day. The student's answer acknowledges the differing interpretations without clearly stating the timeline as per the reference answer, thus detracting from the alignment with the specifically Christian worldview concern provided."
