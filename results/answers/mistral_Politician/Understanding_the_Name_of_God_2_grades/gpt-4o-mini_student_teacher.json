  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 75. \n\nWhile the student correctly mentions that 'Yahweh' is the God of Israel and the central figure in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, they do not fully capture the essence of what the name signifies in the Old Testament. The significance of \"I Am Who I Am\" reflects God's eternal and self-existent nature, as noted in the reference answer provided. Therefore, the student's interpretation, although partially correct, falls short in conveying the profound meaning of God's name."
