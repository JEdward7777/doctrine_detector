## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Name_of_God_2.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In the context of the Old Testament, the name 'Yahweh' signifies the God of Israel, the god who revealed himself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and who is central to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It is a Hebrew word often translated as "I Am Who I Am" or "I Will Be Who I Will Be." This name was considered so sacred by the ancient Hebrews that it was not spoken aloud except in ritual contexts, instead being referred to by the titles such as "Lord" or "God."
