  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer regarding the significance of the name Yahweh in the Old Testament. They discussed its sacredness in different religions, its frequency in the Hebrew Bible, and its association with God's covenant and power. However, the student could have further emphasized the personal nature of God and His relationship with humanity, as outlined in the reference answer. Integrating this specific aspect with more depth would have enhanced the response, resulting in a higher grade."
