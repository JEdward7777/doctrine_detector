However, the answer lacks a clear focus on the continuity of the biblical narrative regarding salvation, as highlighted in the concern. The response also leans more towards a general comparison rather than a specific Christian worldview perspective. Focusing more on the eternal aspect of salvation and the fulfillment of the Old Testament through Jesus Christ would have strengthened the connection between the two concepts."
