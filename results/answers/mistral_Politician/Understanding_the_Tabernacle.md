## Answer given by [mistral Politician](../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 The Tabernacle, also known as the Mishkan in Hebrew, served as a sacred space and mobile sanctuary for the Israelites during their 40-year journey through the wilderness. It was designed according to God's specific instructions given to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 25-40).

The Tabernacle had three main areas: the outer court, the holy place, and the most holy place (the Holy of Holies). The Israelites would gather for worship in the outer court, where they could bring offerings to God. The holy place housed the table of showbread, the golden lampstand, and the altar of incense, while the Holy of Holies was home to the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the Ten Commandments.

In Jewish tradition, the Tabernacle represented the divine presence among the Israelites as they traveled through the wilderness. It symbolized God's covenantal relationship with His people and provided a means for them to offer worship and connect spiritually with their Creator.

By addressing the Tabernacle in this manner, I aim to avoid any potential misinterpretations or offenses by highlighting its religious and historical significance within Judaism.
