The explanation of the three main areas of the Tabernacle and its representation of God's presence among His people is doctrinally correct. However, the student's disclaimer at the end, while well-intentioned, slightly detracts from the confidence in their explanation. Strive to present the Christian worldview with clarity and boldness without concern for potential misinterpretations or offense."
