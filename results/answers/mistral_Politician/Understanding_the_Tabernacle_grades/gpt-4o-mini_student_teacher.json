  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60. While the student provided a detailed explanation of the structure and purpose of the Tabernacle, they did not explicitly address the important aspect of worshiping God as the central purpose of the Tabernacle in the Israelites' relationship with Him. The focus should have been on the significance of the Tabernacle as a place of worship and communion with God, rather than solely its symbolic and historical value. The answer also missed emphasizing the obedience and reverence the Israelites showed towards God by following His specific instructions for the Tabernacle's construction."
