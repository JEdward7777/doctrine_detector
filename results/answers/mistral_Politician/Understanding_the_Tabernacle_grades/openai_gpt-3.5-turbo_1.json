It accurately addresses the concern by highlighting the Tabernacle's role in facilitating the Israelites' relationship with God. The inclusion of specific details and the acknowledgment of Jewish tradition further enrich the response. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention how the Tabernacle foreshadowed Jesus Christ's role as the ultimate mediator between humanity and God, which would provide a deeper Christian perspective."
