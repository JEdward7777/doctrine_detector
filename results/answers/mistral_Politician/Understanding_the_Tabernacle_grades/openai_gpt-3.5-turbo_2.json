It effectively highlights how the Tabernacle represented God's presence among His people and facilitated their connection with Him through worship and the observance of His covenant. The focus on the divine instructions for its construction and its significance within Judaism aligns well with the concern presented. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concerns from a Christian worldview.\n"
