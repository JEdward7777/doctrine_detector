It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how the Tabernacle served as a sacred space for worship and connection with God. The inclusion of information about the different areas of the Tabernacle and its representation of God's covenantal relationship with His people demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The response could have further emphasized the symbolic significance of the Tabernacle in foreshadowing the coming of Christ as the ultimate dwelling place of God among His people."
