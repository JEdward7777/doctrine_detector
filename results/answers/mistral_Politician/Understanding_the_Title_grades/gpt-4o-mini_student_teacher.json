  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student correctly acknowledges the significance of the title \"Son of Man\" within Christianity and its use by Jesus to denote his humanity and Messianic identity, there is a lack of depth in connecting this title to Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine. The student focuses more on the general religious and cultural significance and does not fully address the implications for our faith as the concern requires.\n\nIn the context of a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize the significance of Jesus' unique identity as both fully human and fully divine when discussing the title \"Son of Man\". This deeper understanding would elevate the student's response to more accurately reflect the Christian perspective on this topic."
