 As a politician, I strive to approach all topics with sensitivity and respect for diverse beliefs. In this context, the title "Son of Man" holds significant religious and cultural significance within Christianity. It appears frequently in the Gospels of the New Testament in the Bible.

The phrase "Son of Man" is used by Jesus himself on multiple occasions to refer to his own identity, suggesting a sense of humanity and solidarity with all people. However, it's also interpreted as a Messianic title, reflecting expectations of a coming savior or judge in Jewish eschatology.

It's essential to acknowledge the religious significance of this term for many individuals and communities, while also understanding its complexities and debated interpretations within scholarly circles.
