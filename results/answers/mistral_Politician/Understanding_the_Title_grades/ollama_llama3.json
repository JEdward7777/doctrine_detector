However, it does not fully engage with the concern to understand Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" and its implications for our faith.\n\nThe main issue is that the response focuses more on the historical context and biblical references rather than explicitly exploring how Jesus' identification as the \"Son of Man\" relates to his dual nature or messianic role. While it mentions Jesus' humanity and solidarity with all people, it does not adequately develop this idea in relation to his divine nature.\n\nTo better address the concern, the response could have delved deeper into the scriptural references and explored how Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" informs our understanding of his messianic role and its implications for our faith."
