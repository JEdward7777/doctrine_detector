The additional context provided about the term's usage in the Gospels and its interpretations in both Christianity and Jewish eschatology shows a comprehensive understanding of the topic and its implications for faith. While the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications for faith, overall, it effectively addresses the concern within a Christian worldview."
