  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a respectful and open-minded approach towards the complex concept of the Trinity. They correctly mention the co-equality and co-eternality of the three persons while acknowledging the mystery surrounding this doctrine. However, the answer lacks a clear affirmation of the full divinity of each person of the Trinity as distinct but fully God. Encouraging further study and dialogue is commendable, but a stronger articulation of the essential Christian belief regarding the Trinity would have improved the answer."
