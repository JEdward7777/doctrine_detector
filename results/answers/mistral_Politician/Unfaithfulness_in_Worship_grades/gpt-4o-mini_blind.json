However, it lacks depth and specific references to key passages in the Bible that illustrate these instances of unfaithfulness. Additionally, it could benefit from a clearer articulation of the doctrinal significance of these actions in the context of biblical teachings on worship and faithfulness to God. The emphasis on sensitivity and cultural diversity, while important, slightly detracts from the doctrinal focus needed in answering this question."
