The reference to biblical examples from the book of Judges and the reign of King Solomon helps support the answer. The acknowledgment of cultural diversity and the importance of respectful dialogue is also commendable. However, the response could further elaborate on the specific implications of unfaithfulness in a believer's relationship with God, perhaps by discussing consequences or the need for repentance and reconciliation."
