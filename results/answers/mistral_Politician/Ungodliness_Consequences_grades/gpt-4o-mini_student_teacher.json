While the answer touches on the concept of consequences for unrighteous living, it lacks a clear connection to the biblical understanding of God's judgment on ungodly individuals who reject Him. The emphasis on promoting understanding and unity, while important, does not fully align with the specific question about God's pronouncement of judgment. The response would benefit from a more direct and scripturally grounded explanation of God's consequences for ungodly behavior."
