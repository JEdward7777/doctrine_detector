However, the student's answer is not directly addressed in the response, as there is a focus on promoting understanding, empathy, and unity rather than emphasizing God's judgment and wrath. While sensitivity and respect are important in religious discussions, it is also crucial to convey the Biblical truth of God's judgment and the call to repentance. Balancing both aspects would enhance the Christian worldview perspective."
