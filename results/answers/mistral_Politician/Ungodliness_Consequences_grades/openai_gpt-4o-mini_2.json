The references to the Book of Proverbs and the parable of the Prodigal Son were appropriate in illustrating the consequences of unrighteous living. However, there was a lack of direct engagement with the specific concern raised about the spiritual ramifications of living in disobedience to God. The response could have further emphasized the importance of repentance and turning back to God in the face of judgment and wrath, aligning more closely with the Christian worldview."
