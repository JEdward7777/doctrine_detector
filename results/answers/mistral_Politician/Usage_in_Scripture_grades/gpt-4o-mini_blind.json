The references given from the Old Testament are relevant and support the explanation provided. However, the inclusion of the verses from Jeremiah 50:29 seems to be out of place and doesn't directly relate to the term \"Holy One\". In the New Testament section, the verses from Mark, Acts, and Romans are relevant and help illustrate the concept discussed. Overall, a solid answer with some minor issues."
