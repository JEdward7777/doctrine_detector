  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of how the term \"Holy One\" is used in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting God's divine purity and uniqueness. However, there is a missed opportunity to explore the authority and divinity of Jesus specifically in the New Testament context. The student did not connect the term \"Holy One\" directly to Jesus in the New Testament as the reference answer indicated. This connection is crucial for understanding Jesus' authority and divinity as portrayed in the biblical text."
