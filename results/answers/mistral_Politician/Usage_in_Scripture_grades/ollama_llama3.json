However, it falls short of fully exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament, which is the specified concern.\n\nThe response mainly focuses on the usage of the term \"Holy One\" without delving deeper into how this title relates to Jesus' divinity or authority in the New Testament. For example, Mark 1:24 does refer to Jesus as the \"Holy One,\" but the response could have further explored what this means for our understanding of His divine nature and role.\n\nTo improve the grade, I would recommend providing more specific examples from the New Testament that highlight Jesus' divinity and authority, such as His teachings on being the bread of life (John 6), His claims to be the Son of God (Mark 14:62-65), or His power to forgive sins (Matthew 9:2-8)."
