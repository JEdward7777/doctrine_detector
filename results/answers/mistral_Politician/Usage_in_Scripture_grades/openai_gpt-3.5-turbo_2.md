## [Answer](../Usage_in_Scripture.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In both the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament, the term "Holy One" is primarily used to refer to God. It underscores His divine purity, sanctity, and uniqueness.

In the Old Testament:
1. Isaiah 1:4: "Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, children who have become corrupt! They have forsaken the LORD, they have despised the Holy One of Israel."
2. Jeremiah 50:29: "Out of the north there comes up a nation against her, which shall be called a mighty nation, and another kingdom, which shall be called the 'Kingdom of Kings.' It shall come and it shall commit its deeds in Egypt, as a scorpion creeps on its hands. And at the end it shall become void, and none shall heal its wound; a charms of diviners and a spellcasting, all of them are lies."
3. Daniel 7:18: "But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever."

In the New Testament:
1. Mark 1:24: "And He [Jesus] was saying, 'What business is Mine, to interfere in the affairs of men and Satan? If I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out?' So they were all amazed, and began to dispute among themselves."
2. Acts 2:30: "Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, He would raise up Christ to sit on His throne,"
3. Romans 16:27: "To God who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past."
