  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: \nThe response provides a clear explanation of how the term \"Holy One\" is used in the Old Testament and New Testament, specifically highlighting Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament. The reference to Acts 2:30 emphasizes the authority and divinity of Jesus as the promised Messiah, supporting the concern raised. However, to enhance the answer further, more direct verses showcasing Jesus as the \"Holy One\" could have been included, such as Acts 3:14 or Revelation 3:7. Overall, a solid response with a strong biblical foundation and relevant verses."
