It accurately highlights myrrh's dual function as a perfume and embalming agent, citing relevant biblical examples to support the explanation. The mention of the symbolic significance of myrrh in representing sorrow, pain, and the costliness of the individual being honored adds depth to the answer. Overall, a well-researched and well-articulated response. Great job!"
