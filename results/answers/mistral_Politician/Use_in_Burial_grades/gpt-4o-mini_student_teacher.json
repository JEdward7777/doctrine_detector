  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of how myrrh was used in burial practices during biblical times, including examples from the Old and New Testament. The student effectively discusses the cultural significance and symbolic meaning of using myrrh in funerary rites. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more closely on the specific use of myrrh in anointing and preparing the deceased, aligning closer with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
