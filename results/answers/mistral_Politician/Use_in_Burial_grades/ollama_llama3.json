  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response addresses the concern of recognizing the customs surrounding burial practices in biblical times, which can enhance comprehension of cultural contexts in scripture. It provides specific examples from the Old Testament and New Testament to illustrate the use of myrrh in burial practices, demonstrating an understanding of the cultural significance of this practice.\n\nWhile the response does not fully address all aspects of the original answer, it does capture the essence of myrrh's role in preparing dead bodies for burial. The added symbolic meaning of myrrh representing sorrow, pain, and the costliness of death is also a great addition that shows the writer has gone beyond the surface level to understand the cultural significance.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the response could provide more depth and analysis on the cultural context of myrrh's use in burial practices, as well as its connection to biblical themes and stories. Additionally, some minor clarity and organization issues could be addressed to make the response even stronger."
