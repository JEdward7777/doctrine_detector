## [Answer](../Use_in_Burial.md) by [mistral Politician](../../../answering_models/mistral_Politician.md)
 In biblical times, myrrh played an important role in burial practices, serving both as a perfume and as an embalming agent. It was used to anoint or cover the body of the deceased, enhancing its appearance and providing a soothing aroma. The use of myrrh during funerary rites can be seen in several instances throughout the Old Testament, including the burial of Joseph (Genesis 37:25) and the preparation of Jesus' body for burial in the New Testament (Matthew 27:60). This practice was not only a cultural tradition but also had symbolic meaning, representing sorrow, pain, and the bitterness of death, as well as the costliness and importance of the individual being honored.
