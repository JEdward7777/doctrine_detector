The student accurately highlights the use of titles such as \"John the Baptizer\" and \"Jesus Christ\" in relation to the two figures. However, the answer could have been improved by incorporating more specific biblical references to support the points made. Additionally, a deeper analysis of the significance of Jesus being referred to as a \"Teacher\" or \"Master\" in relation to the title \"Rabbi\" would have enhanced the explanation."
