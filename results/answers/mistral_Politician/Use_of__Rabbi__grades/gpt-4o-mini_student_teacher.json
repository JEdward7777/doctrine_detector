  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60. While the student demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context and terminology regarding the title of \"Rabbi,\" they fail to address the concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with John's and Jesus' teachings. The student could improve their response by discussing how the disciples' use of the term \"Rabbi\" reflects the respect and authority attributed to John and Jesus as teachers in their respective roles, as mentioned in the reference answer. A stronger connection between the use of the title \"Rabbi\" and the respect and authority of their teachings would elevate the student's response."
