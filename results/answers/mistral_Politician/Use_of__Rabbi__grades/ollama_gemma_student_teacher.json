They correctly point out that neither John the Baptist nor Jesus held the formal title of \"Rabbi\" during their lifetimes and explain the more appropriate titles used for them. However, the response could have benefited from including more direct evidence from the biblical texts to support the claim that they were sometimes called \"Rabbi\" by their disciples."
