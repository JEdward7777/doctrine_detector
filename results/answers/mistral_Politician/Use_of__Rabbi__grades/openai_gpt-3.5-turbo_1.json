  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response earned a low grade because it inaccurately downplays the significance of the title \"Rabbi\" in relation to Jesus and John the Baptist in the historical context of the New Testament. Both Jesus and John the Baptist were seen as esteemed teachers and spiritual leaders, and the title \"Rabbi\" was indeed used to address them by their disciples, reflecting their roles as authoritative teachers. It is important to recognize the respect and authority associated with their teachings, which the response failed to fully acknowledge."
