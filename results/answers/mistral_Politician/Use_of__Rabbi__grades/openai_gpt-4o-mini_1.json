However, the specific concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings is not fully addressed. The response fails to emphasize the significance of the title \"Rabbi\" in relation to their teachings and authority. There should be a deeper exploration of how being called \"Rabbi\" by disciples reflects their roles as teachers with authority in the Christian worldview."
