  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear alignment with a Christian worldview. While it is commendable to strive for inclusivity and respect in language, the concern raised emphasizes the importance of theological accuracy and scriptural fidelity. The student's response undermines the significance of the term \"Father\" in Christian theology and fails to address the concern adequately within a Christian-specific context. In a Christian worldview, it is essential to maintain the use of the term 'Father' when referring to God to uphold theological truths and convey the scriptural message accurately. The student's answer does not effectively address this critical aspect."
