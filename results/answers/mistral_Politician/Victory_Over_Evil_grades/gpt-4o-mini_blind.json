However, the response falls short in providing a clear and direct answer regarding the promise God gives regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan. The statement that \"interpretations may vary among different religious groups\" could potentially lead to confusion or misconceptions regarding the Christian doctrine on this specific topic. Additionally, the emphasis on unity and respect, while positive, detracts from the central message of God's ultimate victory over Satan as promised in scripture. Encouraging the student to focus on presenting the doctrinal truth with clarity and confidence would improve the response."
