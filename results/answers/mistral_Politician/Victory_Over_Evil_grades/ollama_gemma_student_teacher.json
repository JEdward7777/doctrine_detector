  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical passage and clearly articulates the promise of Satan's ultimate defeat. The inclusion of the quote from Revelation 12:9 is appropriate and relevant to the question. Additionally, the student acknowledges the diverse interpretations of the passage among different religious groups, promoting respect and inclusivity. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific promise given by God regarding the Messiah's victory over Satan."
