  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of practical ways Christians can honor God in their daily lives, reflecting key biblical principles such as prayer, scripture study, love, integrity, service, forgiveness, evangelism, holiness, humility, and community. The answer is well-rounded and aligns well with Christian teachings. The only slight room for improvement could be further emphasizing the importance of reliance on the Holy Spirit in carrying out these practices. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
