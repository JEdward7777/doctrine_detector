  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of modern examples of idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God. The examples given are relevant and accurately reflect the concept of idolatry in Christianity. The language used is respectful and diplomatic, which is important when discussing sensitive topics. One improvement could be to emphasize more explicitly the importance of turning away from these idols and turning towards God in repentance and faith. Overall, a well-done answer."
