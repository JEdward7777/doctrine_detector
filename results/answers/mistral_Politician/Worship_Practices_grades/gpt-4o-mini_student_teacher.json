  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as a 95.\n\nThe student provided a thorough and insightful response by identifying modern examples of idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God. They explained how materialistic pursuits, celebrities, self-reliance, technology, social media, recreational substances, and addictions can potentially become idols in one's life. They also emphasized the importance of ensuring that nothing takes precedence over a relationship with God. The student's answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer and showcases a deep understanding of the concept of idolatry in a Christian worldview. Well done!"
