The mention of zeal being guided by love, compassion, and respect for others is a good addition, aligning with Christian principles of love, forgiveness, and humility. However, the response could have benefitted from providing more Scriptural references to support the explanation of zeal in Christianity. Additionally, the language could have been more precise and theological in conveying the doctrinal aspects of zeal."
