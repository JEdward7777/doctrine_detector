While the original answer emphasized the symbolic representation of God's mercy and redemption in connection with the atonement lid, the response could have included more explicitly Christian perspectives, such as understanding the fulfillment of atonement through Jesus Christ in the New Testament. Overall, the response effectively addressed the concern by discussing the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament."
