It correctly highlighted its significance in representing God's mercy and atonement for the sinful human beings, as well as the high priest serving as an intermediary between the people and God. The response effectively addressed the concern about understanding the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament from a Christian specific worldview. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the Christian perspective and how the concept of atonement in the Old Testament foreshadowed the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ in the New Testament."
