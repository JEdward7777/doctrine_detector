  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and informative response regarding the historical and cultural context of the term \"abomination of desolation\" as it relates to the events of the Maccabean Revolt and Seleucid rule over Judea. However, the Christian-specific concern of recognizing the seriousness of defiling God's sacred spaces and understanding prophetic warnings in the Bible was not directly addressed. It would have been beneficial for the student to connect the significance of the 'abomination of desolation' with the Christian perspective on the importance of honoring sacred spaces and recognizing prophetic warnings as outlined in the reference answer."
