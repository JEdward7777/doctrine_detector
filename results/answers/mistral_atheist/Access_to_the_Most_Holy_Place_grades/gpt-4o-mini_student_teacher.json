  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 85.\n\nThe student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the significance of only the High Priest being permitted to enter the Holy of Holies, linking it to the holiness of God, the need for atonement, and the role of the High Priest. They also mentioned the symbolism and rituals associated with this restriction effectively. However, the student's answer could have been improved by highlighting the direct connection between maintaining the holiness of God's presence and the importance of recognizing the necessary protocols for approaching Him, as outlined in the concern provided. By explicitly addressing this connection, the student's response would have aligned more closely with the Christian worldview perspective on approaching the holiness of God."
