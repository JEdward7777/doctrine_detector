It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the holiness of God and the importance of adhering to specific protocols when approaching Him. The explanation is well-supported with references to the Hebrew Bible and the practices associated with the Day of Atonement. The inclusion of various purposes served by this restriction enhances the depth of the response. Overall, it demonstrates a sound grasp of the Christian worldview concerning the holiness of God and the role of the High Priest in mediating between God and the people."
