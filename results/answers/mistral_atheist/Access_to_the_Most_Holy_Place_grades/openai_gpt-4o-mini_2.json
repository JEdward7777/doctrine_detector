It effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the holiness of God and the necessary protocols for approaching Him within the context of ancient Jewish religion. The references to the Hebrew Bible and the significance of the Ark of the Covenant further support the Christian worldview perspective on the importance of purity and reverence in approaching God."
