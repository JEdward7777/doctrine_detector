  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a strong response that effectively connects the concept of being 'unfaithful' in marriage to the breach of trust, loyalty, and commitment within religious and cultural contexts. The student also acknowledges the broader implications of the term 'unfaithful' in modern and secular understandings of marriage. While the student's answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher, there is a slight lack of emphasis on the parallel between marital unfaithfulness and Israel's unfaithfulness to God, which is a crucial aspect from a Christian-specific worldview. Overall, a comprehensive and well-written response."
