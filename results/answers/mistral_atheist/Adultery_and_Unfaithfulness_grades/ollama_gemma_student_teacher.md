## [Answer](../Adultery_and_Unfaithfulness.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of traditional religious or cultural descriptions of marriage, the term 'unfaithful' is often used to denote a breach of loyalty, trust, and commitment between married individuals. This breach is typically associated with infidelity, which refers to sexual acts outside the marriage or emotional intimacy with someone other than one's spouse.

In many religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, monogamy is considered a sacred bond, and adultery (the act of being unfaithful) is seen as sinful and harmful to this sacred union. The concept of fidelity within marriage is thus deeply tied to the religious and cultural values of faithfulness, trust, honesty, and respect for one's partner.

However, it's important to note that definitions can vary based on cultural context, and the term "unfaithful" may also encompass emotional betrayal or neglect in more modern or secular understandings of marriage.

In essence, being 'unfaithful' within the context of marriage is about breaking the trust, loyalty, and commitment that are central to this institution as described in religious and cultural texts.
