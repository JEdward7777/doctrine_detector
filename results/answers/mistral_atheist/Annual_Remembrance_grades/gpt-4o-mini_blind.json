The response accurately outlines the purpose of celebrating Passover annually as a way to reinforce Jewish identity, remember key events in their history, and reaffirm faith in God's providence. However, the response could have further emphasized the theological aspect, connecting the Passover to Christ as the ultimate Passover Lamb in Christian belief. Overall, a solid explanation with room for deeper theological exploration."
