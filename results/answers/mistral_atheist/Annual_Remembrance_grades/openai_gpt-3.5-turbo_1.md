# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a responsible AI model, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations, including religious ones. However, I can provide information based on various historical and cultural contexts, such as the Passover celebration in the Bible.

The Passover is one of the most significant festivals in Judaism, commemorating the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery around 1300 BCE. The command to celebrate it every year is given in Exodus 12:14-17 and 13:8-10.

The purpose of the Passover has both ritualistic and historical significance:

1. Ritualistic Significance: The Passover celebration reinforces Jewish identity, community, and faith by remembering their roots and the events that shaped their history. It is a time for families to gather, share stories, and reaffirm their commitment to their religious traditions.

2. Historical Significance: The Passover commemorates the plague of the firstborn afflicting Egyptians but sparing Israelites when the Angel of Death passed over the homes marked with the blood of a lamb. This event is seen as a miraculous intervention by God that led to the Israelites' freedom from bondage in Egypt.

The annual observance of Passover serves as a reminder of these events and their meaning for the Jewish people, reaffirming their belief in God's power and providence while reinforcing their unique cultural and religious identity.
