It effectively connects the commemoration of the Israelites' liberation with the command for annual celebration in the Bible. The emphasis on remembering God's victory and deliverance aligns well with the concern of recognizing the importance of remembrance in Christian faith. However, from a Christian worldview, the response could have further emphasized the foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate deliverance from sin and bondage, linking the Passover to the Christian celebration of Easter. Nevertheless, the response provides a solid understanding of the Passover tradition."
