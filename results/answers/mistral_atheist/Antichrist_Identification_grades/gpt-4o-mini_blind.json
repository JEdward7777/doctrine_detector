It accurately highlights the key points regarding denying Jesus Christ in the flesh, denying His Sonship, and leading people away from His teachings. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate the importance of acknowledging Jesus as the Messiah and Savior in addition to being the Son of God. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound analysis."
