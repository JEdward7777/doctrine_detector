## Question [Antichrist Identification](../../../questions/Antichrist_Identification.md)
According to the apostle John, what defines a person as an antichrist?

## Correct Answer
A person is identified as an antichrist if they deceive people by saying that Jesus is not the Messiah or by denying that Jesus is both God and human.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the traits of antichrists helps Christians recognize and resist false teachings.

## [Answer](../Antichrist_Identification.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 According to the New Testament of the Christian Bible, specifically 1 John 2:18-22 and 4:3, the term "antichrist" is not used to denote a single individual but rather a spirit or attitude that denies Jesus Christ. The apostle John defines an antichrist as anyone who:

1) Denies that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh (1 John 2:22, 4:3). This suggests that they reject both the physical and spiritual aspects of Jesus' existence.

2) Does not acknowledge that Jesus is the Son of God (1 John 4:3).

3) Leads people away from the teachings of Christ (1 John 2:18-19). This could be interpreted as promoting false doctrines or leading others astray from the principles taught by Jesus.

It's important to note that this interpretation is based on Christian scripture, and it may not align with the beliefs or interpretations of scholars or individuals from other religious or non-religious backgrounds.
