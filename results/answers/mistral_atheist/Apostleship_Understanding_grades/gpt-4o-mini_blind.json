The answer neglects to discuss the spiritual calling, the power of the Holy Spirit, and the divine commission given by Jesus to the apostles. A Christian-specific worldview would emphasize the apostles' role as ambassadors of Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit to fulfill the Great Commission and proclaim the good news of salvation to all nations. The response would benefit from integrating these key doctrinal elements to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the significance of the apostles' mission in the early Christian movement."
