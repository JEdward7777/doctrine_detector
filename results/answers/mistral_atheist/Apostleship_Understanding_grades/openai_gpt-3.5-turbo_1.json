It effectively connects the concept of apostleship with the mission of the Great Commission, demonstrating an understanding of their authority and mission. The evaluation would have been enhanced by incorporating more explicit references to the Great Commission and its role in guiding the apostles' mission. Nevertheless, the response effectively addresses the concern within a Christian worldview."
