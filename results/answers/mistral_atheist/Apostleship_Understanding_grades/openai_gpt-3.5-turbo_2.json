The discussion effectively addresses the concern of understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission by highlighting the significance of the apostles in spreading the message of Jesus and establishing the early church. However, the response could have incorporated more explicitly Christian theological perspectives, such as the divine authority given to the apostles by Jesus and their unique role in carrying out the Great Commission. Overall, it is a well-reasoned and insightful response."
