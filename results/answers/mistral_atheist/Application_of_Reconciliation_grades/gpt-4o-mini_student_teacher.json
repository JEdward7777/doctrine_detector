  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained list of practical ways in which Christians can apply the principle of reconciliation in their relationships with others. They have drawn on various Biblical teachings to support their points. However, the student's response may have gone into too much detail and additional examples beyond the core principles of reconciliation. Focusing on the key aspects of pursuing peace, restoring good relations, and forgiving others, as mentioned in the reference answer, would have made the response more concise and aligned with the concern of understanding the practical implications of reconciliation in daily life."
