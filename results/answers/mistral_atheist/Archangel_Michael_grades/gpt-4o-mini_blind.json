It references relevant Bible verses to support the information provided. The answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning that the Bible does not explicitly name the \"archangel\" in Daniel 10:13, rather than leaving it open-ended. Additionally, the mention of differing beliefs among Christian denominations adds a layer of complexity and awareness to the explanation. Good job overall!"
