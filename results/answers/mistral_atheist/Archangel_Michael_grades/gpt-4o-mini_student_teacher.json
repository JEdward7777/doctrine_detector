  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation about archangels in Christian theology, mentioning both Michael and Gabriel. However, the concern specifically focuses on recognizing Michael as the only archangel referred to in the Bible, which the student did not emphasize. The student's answer could have been improved by highlighting the unique position of Michael in spiritual warfare and intercession, as mentioned in the concern."
