## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Tabernacle, as described in the Old Testament, the Ark of the Covenant had a specific and designated place. It was kept within the Most Holy Place, which was the innermost part of the Tabernacle. The Tabernacle was divided into two main sections: the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place.

The Most Holy Place, also known as the Holy of Holies, could only be entered by the High Priest once a year during the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). Inside this sacred space, there were three objects: the Ark of the Covenant, a pot of manna, and Aaron's staff that budded. The Ark was a chest made of acacia wood covered with gold, with a gold molding around it and two golden cherubim on each end.

As an atheistic scholar, I must emphasize that these religious accounts are considered mythological or historical narratives in the scholarly community, as there is no archaeological or scientific evidence supporting the existence of the Tabernacle or the Ark of the Covenant.
