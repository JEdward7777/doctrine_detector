However, it is important to note that the dismissive tone towards the religious significance of the Ark and the Tabernacle in the scholarly community, without acknowledging the faith-based perspective, may be viewed as disrespectful to those who hold these beliefs as foundational to their faith. It is essential to approach such topics with sensitivity and respect for differing beliefs and worldviews."
