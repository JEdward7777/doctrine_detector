  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a clear and accurate explanation of where the Ark of the Covenant was located in the Tabernacle, emphasizing its placement in the Most Holy Place. The student also correctly explained the significance of the Most Holy Place in relation to the presence of God. However, deducting points for the inclusion of the comment as an atheistic scholar, which introduces a conflicting worldview and casts doubt on the historical and religious significance of the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant."
