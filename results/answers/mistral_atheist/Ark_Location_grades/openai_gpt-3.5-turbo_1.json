This demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of the most holy place as the sacred dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The response appropriately addresses the concern about understanding the presence of God in the context of the Tabernacle. The deduction in points is minimal due to the mention of the scholarly viewpoint and lack of evidence, which is a valid concern from an atheistic scholar perspective, but does not significantly detract from the understanding of the religious significance of the Ark's location."
