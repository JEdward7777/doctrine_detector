However, the atheistic perspective expressed in the scholarly commentary dismisses the religious significance and undermines the belief in the presence of God as portrayed in the Old Testament narrative. From a Christian worldview, it is important to recognize the spiritual importance and reverence associated with the Most Holy Place as a symbol of God's presence and holiness."
