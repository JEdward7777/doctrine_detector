The concern mentioned was not addressed, and the concluding statement from an atheistic scholar diminishes the spiritual and religious importance attributed to the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant in Christian belief. Further elaboration on the significance of the Most Holy Place and the concept of God's presence within it, in line with Christian teachings, would have improved the response."
