  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and detailed explanation of the assurance given to believers through faith in Jesus, referencing relevant biblical passages and emphasizing the importance of living a righteous life guided by Christian principles. However, the answer could have been improved by more directly and concisely stating the specific assurance given to believers, as provided in the reference answer. Additionally, while acknowledging the diversity of interpretations within Christianity is important, the response could have been strengthened by affirming the core Christian belief that salvation is granted through faith in Jesus alone."
