However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing the importance of living out this genuine love authentically as a crucial aspect of representing Christ's love effectively in the world from a Christian perspective. Adding this aspect would have provided a more holistic understanding of the verse in relation to faith and Christian witness."
