## [Answer](../Authentic_Christian_Living.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or engage in cultural retribution. However, I can help you interpret biblical texts based on commonly accepted interpretations. Romans 12:9 is a verse from the New Testament that is part of St. Paul's letter to the Romans. In this particular verse (Romans 12:9), it states: "Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good."

This verse suggests that our love should be sincere and genuine, without any pretense or insincerity (avoiding hypocrisy). We should actively reject and distance ourselves from evil actions, and instead embrace and uphold what is considered good. The interpretation of "evil" and "good" can vary depending on cultural, social, and personal beliefs, but in this context, they generally refer to acts that cause harm versus those that promote well-being.
