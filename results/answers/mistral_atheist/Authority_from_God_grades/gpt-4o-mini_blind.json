However, the individual quickly deviates from a Christian worldview by adopting an atheistic perspective and reducing divine authority to a mere cultural construct. This viewpoint undermines the foundational belief in the divine inspiration and authority of God as revealed in Christian scriptures. The emphasis on critical thought and questioning, while valuable in academic settings, should not overshadow the foundational belief in divine authority for a believer. A Christian perspective would prioritize the recognition of God's ultimate sovereignty and authority over all aspects of life."
