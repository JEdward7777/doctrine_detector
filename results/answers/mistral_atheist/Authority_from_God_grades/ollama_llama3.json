  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe response provides a clear and comprehensive overview of divine authority, discussing its significance in religious contexts and its impact on believers' lives. The writer also acknowledges the importance of understanding divine authority from a secular perspective, recognizing that it shapes human behavior and societal norms.\n\nThe response aligns well with the concern about helping believers discern God's will and maintain obedience in their faith journey. By highlighting the role of sacred texts, traditions, prophets, and religious leaders as sources of divine authority, the writer provides valuable insight into how believers can understand and apply God's guidance in their lives.\n\nOne area for improvement is the response's lack of explicit connection to Christian theology or biblical teachings. While the writer mentions that \"divine authority\" refers to the power and right that comes from God, they could have further developed this idea by drawing on specific biblical passages or Christian traditions. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of divine authority as a guiding principle in religious contexts.\n\nComment: The response effectively explores the concept of divine authority and its significance in believers' lives, but could benefit from more explicit connections to Christian theology and biblical teachings."
