  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50 \n\nComment: The response acknowledges the concept of divine authority but takes a secular perspective in analyzing it, thus missing the importance of divine authority in helping believers discern God's will and maintain obedience in their faith journey, a crucial aspect from a Christian worldview. The response does not fully align with the concern provided, resulting in a lower grade."
