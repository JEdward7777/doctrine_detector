The perspective presented is solely from an atheistic viewpoint, lacking a Christian-specific worldview that emphasizes the importance of divine authority in guiding believers' moral and spiritual decisions. Incorporating insights on the significance of divine authority in shaping believers' obedience and faith journey from a Christian perspective would have significantly enhanced the response."
