While it is essential to appreciate differing perspectives, the scholar's focus on secular analysis disregards the foundational Christian principle that understanding divine authority is crucial for believers to discern God's will and maintain obedience in their faith journey. A Christian worldview emphasizes the truth of divine authority as fundamental to understanding and practicing the faith."
