  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers over their citizens, citing relevant passages such as Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Peter 2:13-14. The student correctly emphasizes the importance of obedience to governing authorities while also highlighting the ultimate authority of God and the need to act in accordance with moral principles. To improve, the student could strengthen the connection between obeying earthly authorities and honoring God through submission. Additionally, a clearer distinction between the limitations of human authority and the absolute authority of God would enhance the response."
