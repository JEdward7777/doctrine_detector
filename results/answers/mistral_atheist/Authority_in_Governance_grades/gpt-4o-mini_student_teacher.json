  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained answer citing relevant Bible passages on the authority of governing rulers. They also appropriately touched on the balance between obeying human authorities and the ultimate authority of God. However, the student could have focused more on the direct affirmation of governing rulers' authority established by God as mentioned in the reference answer to align more closely with the concern provided."
