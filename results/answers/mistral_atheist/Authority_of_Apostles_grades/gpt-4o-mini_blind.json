  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The response provides a good overview of how the authority of the apostles related to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. However, from a Christian worldview, there are some critical doctrinal errors. The student's mention of a \"scholarly, atheistic perspective\" that interprets miracles as symbolic or metaphorical strays from orthodox Christian beliefs in the literal truth of the miracles performed by the apostles. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of miracles and preaching in relation to the apostles' authority as established by Jesus Christ. Overall, the student demonstrates a basic understanding but lacks doctrinal correctness and clarity in articulating Christian beliefs."
