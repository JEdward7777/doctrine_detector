  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed exploration of the authority of the apostles and their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly within the context of early Christianity. However, the student's perspective lacks a clear emphasis on the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for their ministry, as outlined in the provided reference answer. The focus on scholarly, atheistic interpretations detracts from a Christian worldview perspective on the apostles' authority and miraculous abilities. The response touches on important aspects of the topic but falls short of fully addressing the concern from a Christian-specific viewpoint."
