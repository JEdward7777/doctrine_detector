  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that thoughtfully considers the relationship between the authority of the apostles and their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly from a Christian perspective. \n\nThe student provides a clear explanation of how the apostles' direct association with Jesus Christ gave them a unique authority and how their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly were seen as confirmations of that authority. The student also acknowledges the importance of the apostles' message and authenticity rather than their miraculous abilities as the ultimate source of their authority. \n\nThe inclusion of a scholarly perspective adds depth to the response, considering alternative interpretations of the miracles and the authority of the apostles from an atheistic standpoint. However, it would have been beneficial to explore the theological interpretations of the miracles and authority from a Christian perspective."
