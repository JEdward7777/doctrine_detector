  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a good job of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, as specified in the concern. It provides specific examples from the New Testament to support its claims, such as the apostles' direct association with Jesus Christ and their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. The response also acknowledges that the authority of the apostles was not absolute, but rather derived from their role as messengers of Jesus' teachings.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where this response could be improved. For example, it does not explicitly address how the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles relates to their message or ministry. Additionally, while the response acknowledges that the early Christian communities did not consider miracles as an end in themselves, but rather as a means to validate and spread the gospel message, it could have explored this idea further.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry. With some additional development and exploration of these ideas, it has the potential to be an even stronger response.\n\nComment: This response receives 85 points because it provides specific examples from the New Testament and acknowledges that the authority of the apostles was not absolute. However, it could have explored how the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles relates to their message or ministry further."
