The exploration of miracles as signs of divine approval and the importance of preaching boldly as evidence of faith are well-supported with scriptural references. The response effectively captures the Christian worldview on the topic and demonstrates a deep understanding of the complexities surrounding the authority of the apostles in early Christianity."
