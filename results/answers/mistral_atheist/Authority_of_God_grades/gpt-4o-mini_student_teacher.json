  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer, showcasing an understanding of the historical and cultural context of the term \"Yahweh of hosts.\" The explanation of Yahweh's authority over spiritual beings was clear and insightful. However, there was a slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer in terms of emphasizing God's supreme authority over all creation, which slightly impacts the grade."
