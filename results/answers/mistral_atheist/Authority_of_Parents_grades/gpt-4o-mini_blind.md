## [Answer](../Authority_of_Parents.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, the concept of parental authority over children is rooted in several passages across both the Old Testament and New Testament. Here are a few examples:

1) Exodus 20:12 - "Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you." This commandment emphasizes the respect and obedience owed to parents as part of fulfilling the law of God.

2) Ephesians 6:1-3 - "Children, obey your parents because you belong to the Lord, for this is the right thing to do. 'Honor your father and mother.' This is the first commandment with a promise: If you honor your father and mother, 'things will go well for you, and you will have a long life on the earth.'"

3) Proverbs 23:13-14 - "Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish them with the rod, they will not die. Punish them with the rod and save them from death." This verse suggests that while discipline is important, it should be used judiciously and as a means of correction rather than punishment.

4) Colossians 3:20-21 - "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is your acceptable duty in the Lord. It is right for us to do this, because 'Whoever honors their father and mother' is commended by God.'"

These passages highlight the responsibility of children to honor and obey their parents as part of their religious duties, reflecting the cultural contexts in which they were written. The Bible also emphasizes that parents are to nurture, teach, and care for their children, providing guidance and wisdom for them as they grow. This relationship is a key aspect of the broader social fabric within the Biblical narrative.
