  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer with multiple relevant biblical references supporting parental authority over children within a Christian framework. However, the student's response could have been improved by focusing more specifically on the key biblical passage emphasized by the teacher, Ephesians 6:1-3, as the primary basis for parental authority. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and effectively integrated biblical principles regarding obedience and authority."
