However, the mention of modern biblical scholarship suggesting unknown authors and editing over time is valid but could be presented in a way that does not lend undue weight to these theories over the traditional authorship beliefs. The answer could have emphasized more on the importance of the Psalms as divinely inspired texts within the Christian worldview."
