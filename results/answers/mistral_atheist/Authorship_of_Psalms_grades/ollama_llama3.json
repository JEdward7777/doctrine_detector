  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by mentioning some key figures involved in writing the Psalms, including King David, Moses, Solomon, and Asaph. This shows an understanding that the authorship of the Psalms is important for understanding their messages and themes. However, it falls short in not providing a clear or comprehensive answer to the question about the authors of the Psalms.\n\nA higher grade would require a more detailed and accurate response that takes into account both the traditional attributions and modern scholarship on authorship."
