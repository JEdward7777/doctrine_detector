## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The Book of Psalms in the Old Testament of the Bible is traditionally attributed to various authors, collectively known as the "Sons of Korah" (Psalm 42-49, 84, 85, 87-88), King David (Psalm 1-41, 51-68, 73, 138-145), and various other figures such as Moses, Solomon, Asaph, Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman the Ezrahite, and Jeduthun (Psalms 40:1-3; 72:20; 88:1). However, modern biblical scholarship suggests that many of these psalms were written by unknown authors or edited over a long period of time. The exact authorship remains a matter of debate among scholars.
