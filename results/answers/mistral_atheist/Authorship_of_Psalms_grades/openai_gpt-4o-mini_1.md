## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The Book of Psalms in the Old Testament of the Bible is traditionally attributed to various authors, collectively known as the "Sons of Korah" (Psalm 42-49, 84, 85, 87-88), King David (Psalm 1-41, 51-68, 73, 138-145), and various other figures such as Moses, Solomon, Asaph, Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman the Ezrahite, and Jeduthun (Psalms 40:1-3; 72:20; 88:1). However, modern biblical scholarship suggests that many of these psalms were written by unknown authors or edited over a long period of time. The exact authorship remains a matter of debate among scholars.

Comment: The response correctly identifies key figures traditionally associated with writing the Psalms, but it fails to acknowledge the complexities and uncertainties surrounding authorship as indicated by modern biblical scholarship. While recognizing traditional authorship can provide some insight into the context of the Psalms, a deeper understanding requires acknowledging the ongoing debate and variations in authorship attribution.
