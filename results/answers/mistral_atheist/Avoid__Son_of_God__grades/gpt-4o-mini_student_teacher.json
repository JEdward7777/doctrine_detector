  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provides a well-reasoned response considering the concerns of potential misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures, the answer does not align with a Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, the term \"Son of God\" is a crucial aspect of Jesus' identity and should not be avoided but rather taught and explained within its theological context. The student's answer lacks recognition of the importance of maintaining theological accuracy and clarity in translations of religious texts, particularly in conveying the identity of Jesus Christ as the Son of God."
