While suggesting alternative phrases to avoid confusion is mentioned, it does not directly engage with the potential theological gaps and misunderstandings that could arise from avoiding the term \"Son of God.\" The response does not fully align with the Christian specific worldview that emphasizes the importance of teaching and explaining the meaning of key theological concepts rather than avoiding them."
