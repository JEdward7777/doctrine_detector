Avoiding the term can indeed lead to theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity, as stated in the concern. Therefore, the response does not align with a Christian worldview that emphasizes the significance of Jesus as the Son of God. Encouraging teaching and clarification of the term within its proper context would have been a more appropriate approach."
