The explanations are clear and supported with relevant biblical references. However, there is room for improvement in explicitly stating the doctrinal significance of baptism as a sacrament in Christian theology, such as it being a means of grace and initiation into the body of Christ. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the symbolic significance of baptism in relation to the believer's identification with Christ's death and resurrection would enhance the doctrinal accuracy of the response."
