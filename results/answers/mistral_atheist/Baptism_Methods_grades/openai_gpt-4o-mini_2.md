## [Answer](../Baptism_Methods.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, there are three primary methods of baptism mentioned: immersion (submersion), affusion (pouring), and aspersion (sprinkling). Let us examine each method and consider their interpretations within various Christian contexts.

1. Immersion or Submersion (Matthew 3:16; Acts 8:38-39): In this mode, the individual is fully submerged in water. Some groups, such as Baptists and Oneness Pentecostals, practice baptism by immersion. They interpret it as a symbol of burial and resurrection, representing the believer's death to sin and new life in Christ.

2. Affusion (Pouring) (Acts 2:38; Acts 10:47-48): In this method, water is poured over the person being baptized. The Syrian Orthodox Church, Coptic Orthodox Church, and other Eastern Orthodox Churches often practice baptism by affusion. They interpret this as a washing or cleansing from sin, marking the individual's entry into the church community.

3. Aspersion (Sprinkling) (Exodus 12:22; Hebrews 10:22): In this method, water is sprinkled or drizzled onto the person being baptized. Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and many Protestant denominations practice baptism by aspersion. They interpret it as a sign of God's grace and spiritual cleansing, often administered to infants.

In modern Christianity, various denominations may place different emphases on the significance and mode of baptism based on their theological convictions and traditions. Some emphasize the importance of faith in salvation (such as Baptists), while others stress the role of baptism in incorporating new members into the church community (like the Eastern Orthodox Church). Ultimately, each Christian group interprets baptism within the context of their particular beliefs and practices.
