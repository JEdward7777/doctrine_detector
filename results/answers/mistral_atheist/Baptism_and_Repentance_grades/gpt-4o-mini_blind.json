  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid explanation of the relationship between repentance and baptism in the New Testament, highlighting the importance of both as steps towards salvation within the early Christian community. The response effectively connects the concepts of repentance and baptism, citing key passages like Acts 2:38 to support the connection. However, the response could have been strengthened by including more explicit references to the theological significance of baptism as a symbol of identification with Christ and the significance of repentance as a turning away from sin towards God's will. Additionally, emphasizing the role of faith in conjunction with repentance and baptism would have provided a more holistic perspective on the topic."
