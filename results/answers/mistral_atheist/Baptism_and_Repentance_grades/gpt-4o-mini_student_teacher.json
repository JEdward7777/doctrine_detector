  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the relationship between repentance and baptism in the New Testament from a historical and cultural perspective. They correctly emphasized the importance of repentance as a prerequisite for baptism, aligning with Christian doctrine. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by clearly stating the direct relationship between repentance and baptism without solely emphasizing the historical context. Nonetheless, they demonstrated a good understanding of the topic."
