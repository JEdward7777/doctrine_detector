  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'gracious' and its implications in interactions with others. However, the answer lacks a specific reference to the Christian obligation to be forgiving and kind, as highlighted in the concern. The student did acknowledge the potential religious associations of 'gracious', but primarily focused on practical and secular implications. To align more closely with the Christian worldview, the response should have emphasized the importance of extending kindness and forgiveness in line with Christian teachings."
