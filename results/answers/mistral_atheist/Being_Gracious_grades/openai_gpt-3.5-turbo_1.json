However, the response falls short in fully emphasizing the Christian perspective on graciousness and the theological significance behind extending grace to others, particularly in light of God's forgiveness towards humanity through Jesus Christ. It would have been stronger if it had incorporated more explicit references to Christian teachings on forgiveness and kindness."
