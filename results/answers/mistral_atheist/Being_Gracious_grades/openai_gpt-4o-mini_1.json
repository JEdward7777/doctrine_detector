In Christianity, the obligation to be forgiving and kind is rooted in the belief that humans are inherently sinful and in need of redemption, and that mirroring God's grace and forgiveness is essential in relationships. The response should have emphasized the Christian perspective on graciousness as an extension of God's love and mercy towards others, especially towards those who have wronged us."
