They accurately highlight key aspects such as the resurrection of the dead, reward and punishment, belief in angels, demons, and spirits, and the significance of the oral Torah in Pharisaic beliefs. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the subject matter and effectively connects these beliefs to the broader context of Judaism and their influence on early Christianity. Well done!"
