They highlighted key aspects of Pharisaic beliefs such as resurrection of the dead, reward and punishment, angels, demons, and the importance of the oral Torah. The additional information provided enhanced the understanding of the Pharisees' worldview during Jesus' time. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the beliefs of the Pharisees rather than providing general background information."
