 The Pharisees, a Jewish religious group that flourished from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE, held distinctive beliefs about life after death and spiritual beings, which can provide insights into their worldview.

1. Resurrection of the Dead: One of the key tenets of Pharisaic belief was the concept of the resurrection of the dead. They believed that God would raise the bodies of all people at the end of time to be judged according to their deeds in life. This judgment would determine their eternal fate, either in a physical heaven or hell.

2. Reward and Punishment: The Pharisees held an optimistic view of the afterlife, with a strong emphasis on reward and punishment for actions taken during one's lifetime. Good deeds were seen as earning merit in the eyes of God, while bad deeds would incur divine displeasure.

3. Angels, Demons, and Spirits: The Pharisees believed in an unseen world inhabited by angels (beneficent spiritual beings) and demons (malevolent spirits). These entities played a role in influencing events on earth, particularly in response to human actions and prayers. They also held the belief that certain individuals could serve as intermediaries between God and humanity, known as prophets or righteous men who could communicate God's will and receive divine guidance.

4. Oral Torah: The Pharisees placed great emphasis on the oral tradition (later codified in the Mishnah and Talmud) as an essential part of Jewish law. They believed that this oral interpretation was given by God through prophets, angels, or at Sinai, and it guided their understanding of God's will and how to live a righteous life.

These beliefs helped shape the Pharisees' approach to religious practice, communal governance, and moral living. It is essential to understand these beliefs when examining the history and culture of ancient Judaism and their influence on early Christianity.
