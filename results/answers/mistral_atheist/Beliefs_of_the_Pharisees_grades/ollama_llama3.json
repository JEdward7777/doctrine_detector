  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the response does mention that the Pharisees believed in life after death and spiritual beings, it only scratches the surface of their beliefs. The answer lacks specific details about their views on resurrection, reward and punishment, angels, demons, and spirits, which are important aspects of their worldview. Additionally, the concern about exploring these beliefs to enhance understanding of the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time is not explicitly addressed in the response.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of Phariseic beliefs and how they relate to the concern about the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time."
