However, the response does not directly address the practical implications of a relationship with Christ as specified in the concern. It focuses more on the spiritual and personal aspects rather than practical implications. More emphasis on how a relationship with Christ impacts daily living, decision-making, relationships, and behavior would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
