While it presents valuable insights from historical, cultural, and sociological angles, the direct connection to the core Christian belief of knowing Christ as Savior and the transformative power of His sacrifice is somewhat lacking. To enhance the response, a stronger integration of the spiritual and theological aspects of a relationship with Christ could have been included to align more closely with the Christian worldview."
