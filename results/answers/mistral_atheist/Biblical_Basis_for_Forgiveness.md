## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a neutral AI, I don't hold personal beliefs, but I can certainly share some verses from the Bible that emphasize the importance of forgiveness among individuals. Here are a few examples:

1. Matthew 6:14-15 (King James Version): "For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."

2. Matthew 18:21-22 (King James Version): "Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."

3. Mark 11:25 (King James Version): "And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."

4. Ephesians 4:31-32 (King James Version): "Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."

5. Colossians 3:12-13 (King James Version): "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye."

These verses underscore the importance of extending forgiveness to others, as it is seen as reflecting God's own attitude towards us.
