## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian tradition, particularly within denominations that follow the New Testament, the role of deacons is significant as they serve to ensure the practical needs of the community are met while allowing clergy to focus on spiritual matters. The New Testament provides a description of the original function and responsibilities of deacons in Acts 6:1-7 and later in I Timothy 3:8-13.

Acts 6 describes the early Christian church's struggle with providing for the material needs of its rapidly growing community. A solution was proposed to appoint seven men, known as deacons (diakonoi), to handle these practical matters like food distribution and care for widows. The qualifications mentioned in Acts 6 include being full of the Spirit and wisdom, and having a reputation for living an honest life.

In I Timothy 3:8-13, the Apostle Paul provides more detailed guidelines for deacons, focusing on their personal and moral character. Qualities emphasized include being dignified, not double-tongued, not indulging in much wine, not aggressive but gentle, not quarrelsome, holding to the mystery of faith with a clear conscience, and being tested first; then, if they prove themselves blameless, they are eligible for the work.

In summary, according to the New Testament, deacons were chosen to manage practical matters within the early Christian community while demonstrating integrity, kindness, and adherence to religious teachings.
