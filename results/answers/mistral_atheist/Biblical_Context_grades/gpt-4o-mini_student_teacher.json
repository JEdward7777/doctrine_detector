  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 75.\n\nThe student accurately described the responsibilities of deacons as outlined in Acts 6 and I Timothy 3:8-13. They correctly identified the practical aspect of caring for the material needs of the community, as well as the emphasis on personal and moral character for deacons. However, the student's answer did not explicitly address the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community, which was a specific focus indicated in the reference answer. \n\nOverall, the student provided a thorough explanation of the responsibilities and qualifications of deacons according to the New Testament, but the lack of direct emphasis on fair treatment and care within the church community slightly detracts from the alignment with the specified concern."
