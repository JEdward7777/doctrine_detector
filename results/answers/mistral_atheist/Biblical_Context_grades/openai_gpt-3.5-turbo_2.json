The answer is well-supported with references to relevant biblical passages, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could be to further emphasize the importance of integrity, character, and adherence to faith in the role of deacons, as highlighted in I Timothy 3:8-13."
