  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided excellent examples of Jesus Christ and Moses as biblical characters who exemplified humility, supported by relevant verses and explanations. However, the answer did not include the specified biblical character, David, as the teacher's reference answer, which would have been more directly aligned with the question. The student effectively demonstrated an understanding of humility in the biblical context but missed the opportunity to directly address the concern of providing a tangible example in line with the teacher's response."
