  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by providing two biblical examples that illustrate humility, namely Jesus Christ and Moses. The examples are well-chosen and supported with specific Scripture references, which adds credibility to the argument. The writer also attempts to draw out the importance of humility as a virtue in the biblical tradition, highlighting its role in enabling individuals to recognize their limitations and rely on a higher power.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more directly addressing the prompt's focus on David. While the examples provided are relevant to the concern, they don't explicitly address the original example given (David). To earn a higher grade, the writer could have attempted to connect the humility demonstrated by Jesus and Moses back to David's character and experiences.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for discussing the importance of humility in the biblical tradition, but could benefit from more explicit connections to the initial prompt."
