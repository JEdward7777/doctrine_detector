## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 Absolutely! One such example can be found in Genesis 1:28, often referred to as the "cultural mandate." In this passage, God blesses humanity and gives them a role in the stewardship of the earth. Here's the verse in context:

"Then God blessed them and said, ‘Be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.’ So God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them." (New International Version, Genesis 1:28-29)

In this passage, God is seen as blessing creation by giving humans a role to play in it, a role that involves caring for and managing it wisely. This can be interpreted as a divine blessing of the natural world through the stewardship of humankind.
