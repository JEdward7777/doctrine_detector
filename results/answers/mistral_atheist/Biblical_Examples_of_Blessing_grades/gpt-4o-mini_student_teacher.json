  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 70. \n\nWhile the student accurately provided an example of God blessing creation from Genesis 1:28, they misinterpreted the passage by focusing on humanity's role in stewardship rather than on the direct act of blessing on creation itself. The reference answer highlights this distinction by providing a clearer example where God explicitly blesses the creatures of the sea and the birds in Genesis 1:22. The student's analysis was well-explained, but a more focused explanation on the concept of blessings in the context of the specific question would have improved the answer."
