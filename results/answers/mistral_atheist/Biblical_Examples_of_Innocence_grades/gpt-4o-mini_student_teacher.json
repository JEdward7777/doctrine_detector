  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided thorough examples from Scripture that highlight Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations. The response effectively demonstrates a Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in key moments in the New Testament. However, the student missed including the specific examples mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher, which could have further strengthened their response."
