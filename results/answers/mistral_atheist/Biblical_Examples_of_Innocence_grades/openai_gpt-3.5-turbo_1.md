## Question [Biblical Examples of Innocence](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md)
Can you provide examples from Scripture that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Jesus being recognized as 'innocent' by the soldier guarding him (Luke 23:47) and the acknowledgment by the other criminal during the crucifixion that he was guilty while Jesus was not.

## Stated Concern
These examples serve to elucidate key moments in the New Testament that affirm the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Christian Scriptures, or New Testament, there are several instances that highlight the concept of innocence, particularly in relation to Jesus Christ and his accusers. Here are three notable examples:

1. Trial before Caiaphas (Matthew 26:59-64): During Jesus' trial before the Sanhedrin, one of the priests' servants accuses Peter, one of Jesus' disciples, of being a follower of Jesus. Peter denies this, stating that he does not know him. After Jesus is arrested, another disciple named Malchus has his ear cut off by a soldier in the process. However, when the leaders question Jesus about this incident, he says, "Those who have drawn their swords came to me and struck together out of sheath, and I said to them, 'Leave these things alone; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.' So if you are looking for peace, why do you come with swords?" (Matthew 26:52-53) Jesus is demonstrating his innocence by not resorting to violence despite being attacked.

2. Trial before Pilate (Luke 23:4-5): After being handed over to Pilate, the Roman governor, the religious leaders accuse Jesus of many crimes, including claiming to be the Son of God and inciting the people to rebel against Rome. Pilate, however, finds no reason to condemn Jesus on these charges (Luke 23:4) and ultimately delivers a verdict that sets Jesus free. The crowd's demand for Jesus' crucifixion leads Pilate to have him flogged and then sentenced to death, demonstrating Jesus' innocence in the eyes of the Roman authorities.

3. Trial before Herod (Luke 23:6-12): During another aspect of Jesus' trial, he is sent to King Herod for questioning due to false accusations that he was John the Baptist resurrected or Elijah. Herod and his soldiers are amused by the charges but find no evidence that Jesus has done anything worthy of death. The encounter between Jesus and Herod highlights his innocence in the face of unfounded accusations.

These examples from Scripture illustrate Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations and violent persecution, reinforcing the Christian belief in Jesus as an innocent sacrifice for humanity's sins.
