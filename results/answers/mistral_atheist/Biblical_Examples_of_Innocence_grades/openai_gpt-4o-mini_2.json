The additional examples of Jesus being recognized as innocent by the soldier guarding him and the acknowledgment of his innocence by the other criminal during the crucifixion further reinforce the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence. The response effectively supports the Christian worldview by highlighting these crucial moments in Scripture."
