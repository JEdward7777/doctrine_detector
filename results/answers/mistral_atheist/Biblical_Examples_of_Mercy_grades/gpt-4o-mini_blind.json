The selected biblical narratives effectively showcase different dimensions of mercy, including God's mercy towards His people and individuals showing mercy to others. However, the student could have strengthened the response by incorporating more explicit references to key theological aspects of mercy within a Christian worldview, such as the concept of undeserved favor and compassion rooted in God's nature. Additionally, emphasizing the redemptive significance of mercy in the context of salvation through Jesus Christ would have further enriched the discussion. Overall, a good understanding of the subject matter was demonstrated, but could benefit from deeper theological reflection and integration."
