The examples chosen demonstrate a clear understanding of mercy within a Christian worldview. However, the response could have further expanded on the real-life applications of mercy, linking the biblical instances to how individuals can embody mercy in their daily lives today. Encouraging deeper exploration and practical application of mercy in the modern context would have further enhanced the overall response."
