  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student accurately presents biblical examples that demonstrate the power and significance of prayer. However, there is a missed opportunity to expound on the transformative nature of prayer in aligning one's will with God's, seeking His guidance, and deepening one's relationship with Him. Encouraging a student to delve deeper into the spiritual and relational aspects of prayer from a Christian worldview would enrich the response."
