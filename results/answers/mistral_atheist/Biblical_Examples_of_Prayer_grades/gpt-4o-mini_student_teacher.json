  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples from the Bible illustrating the power and importance of prayer, showcasing various aspects such as spiritual protection, provision, healing, overcoming adversity, and community ties. However, the examples chosen did not fully align with the concern of learning from biblical stories to foster a stronger prayer life. The student could have included examples that directly emphasized the importance of prayer in one's personal relationship with God and spiritual growth."
