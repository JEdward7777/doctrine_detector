  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 85. \n\nThe student's answer provides excellent examples from the Bible that demonstrate the act of repentance, supporting the practical application of repentance in believers' lives. The examples of Jonah, King David, and Peter are well-explained and demonstrate different aspects of repentance such as recognition of wrongdoing, turning away from sin, expressing remorse, and seeking forgiveness. The student effectively connects these biblical stories to the importance of repentance for believers today. \n\nWhile the student's answer includes additional details compared to the reference answer, it effectively captures the essence of repentance in the Bible and its significance for believers. The additional examples and explanations enhance the depth of understanding and application."
