  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of Biblical references illustrating the concept of transgression, including examples from both the Old and New Testaments. However, the student could have benefitted from incorporating additional references like 1 Thessalonians 4:6, Daniel 9:24-25, and Psalm 32:1, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept but could have further enhanced their response by including a wider range of examples."
