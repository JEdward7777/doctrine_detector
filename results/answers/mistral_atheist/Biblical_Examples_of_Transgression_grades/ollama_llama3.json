  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe given response does provide some Biblical examples of transgression, but they are not as relevant to the concern about learning from Biblical examples to avoid similar pitfalls in one's own life. The examples provided focus more on the concept of transgression rather than how it can be applied personally. Additionally, the response does not explicitly connect the dots between the Biblical examples and the concern.\n\nA higher score would require a more explicit connection between the Biblical examples and the concern about learning from them to avoid similar pitfalls in one's own life."
