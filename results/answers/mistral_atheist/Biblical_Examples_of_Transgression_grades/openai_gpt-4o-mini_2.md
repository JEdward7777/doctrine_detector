 In the Bible, the concept of transgression can be found throughout both the Old and New Testaments, where it refers to acts that violate divine laws or moral principles. Here are a few examples:

1. **Genesis 3**: This passage from the Book of Genesis tells the story of Adam and Eve eating from the Tree of Knowledge, which was forbidden by God. Their disobedience is considered a transgression that results in their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.

2. **Exodus 20:1-17**: These verses contain the Ten Commandments, which outline rules given to Moses by God on Mount Sinai. Transgressing any of these commandments is considered a sin or transgression.

3. **Numbers 15:30-31**: This passage discusses the punishment for someone who unintentionally transgresses one of God's commands, emphasizing the idea that even unintentional disobedience has consequences.

4. **Isaiah 1:2**: In this prophetic book, God expresses His dissatisfaction with the actions of Israel, stating "I have reared and brought up children, and they have rebelled against Me." This is an example of transgression on a larger societal level.

5. **Romans 3:23**: In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul writes in his letter to the Romans that "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," further illustrating the universality of the concept of transgression as it relates to human behavior.

6. **1 John 3:4**: This passage from 1 John emphasizes the importance of avoiding sin or transgression, stating that "everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness."
