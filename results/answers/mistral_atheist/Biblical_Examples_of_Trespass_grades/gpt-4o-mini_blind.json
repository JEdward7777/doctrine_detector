The explanations are clear and tie in with the broader theological principles emphasized in each story. However, there could be a deeper exploration of the theological significance behind the concept of trespass and its implications in the context of Christian beliefs. Additionally, connecting each example more explicitly to the concept of trespass and its consequences would enhance the overall analysis."
