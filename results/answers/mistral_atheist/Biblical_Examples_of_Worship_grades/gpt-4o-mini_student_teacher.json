  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student accurately identified a relevant example from the Bible where worship is contrasted with idol worship, providing a thorough explanation and referencing additional supporting verses. However, they could have directly referenced the specific verse (Exodus 20:3) provided in the teacher's answer to align more closely with the question. Overall, a strong understanding of the concept but slight deviation in the exact reference."
