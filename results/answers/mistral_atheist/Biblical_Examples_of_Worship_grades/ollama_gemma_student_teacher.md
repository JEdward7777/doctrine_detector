## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 Absolutely! One of the most well-known examples can be found in the Old Testament, specifically in Exodus 20:4-5 (King James Version):

"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me."

In this passage, the commandment against idolatry is given. It contrasts the worship of God with the making and worshiping of graven images or idols, suggesting that only the true God is worthy of worship, not any physical objects or false gods. This theme is repeated throughout the Bible, emphasizing monotheism and the rejection of idolatry. For instance, in Isaiah 44:9-20, the prophet condemns idol worship and contrasts it with the living God who created and sustains all things.
