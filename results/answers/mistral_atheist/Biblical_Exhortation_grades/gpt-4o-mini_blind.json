  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60 \n\nComment: The student accurately cited the relevant passages in the Bible where Jesus gave his directive to his apostles regarding the good news, known as the Great Commission. However, the response falls short in understanding the significance and authority of Jesus' command, as it presents the information solely from a historical perspective detached from the religious context. It fails to acknowledge the spiritual and theological implications of the directive, thus missing the foundational aspect of Jesus' teachings within Christianity."
