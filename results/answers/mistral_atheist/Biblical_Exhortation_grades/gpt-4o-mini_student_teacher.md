## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar and an atheist, my role is to present historical facts accurately without interpreting them from a religious perspective.

According to the New Testament of the Bible, Jesus' primary instruction to his apostles about the "good news" (often translated as "gospel") can be found in Matthew 28:19-20, Mark 16:15, and Luke 24:46-48. In these passages, Jesus is reported to have commanded his disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he had commanded them. This instruction is often referred to as the Great Commission. However, it's important to note that interpretations and beliefs about this commandment vary greatly among different religious groups and individuals.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student accurately presented the historical facts regarding Jesus' directive to his apostles in the New Testament, specifically referencing the Great Commission. However, the answer fell short in recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith from a Christian perspective. As a scholar, it is important to understand and acknowledge the significance of evangelism in Christianity, which involves spreading the good news of Jesus Christ for salvation. By solely presenting the facts without acknowledging the theological significance of the Great Commission, the answer lacks depth in understanding the Christian worldview on evangelism.
