## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar and an atheist, my role is to present historical facts accurately without interpreting them from a religious perspective.

According to the New Testament of the Bible, Jesus' primary instruction to his apostles about the "good news" (often translated as "gospel") can be found in Matthew 28:19-20, Mark 16:15, and Luke 24:46-48. In these passages, Jesus is reported to have commanded his disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he had commanded them. This instruction is often referred to as the Great Commission. However, it's important to note that interpretations and beliefs about this commandment vary greatly among different religious groups and individuals.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

While the response does mention the importance of evangelism, it falls short in accurately capturing the essence of Jesus' Great Commission. The original answer focuses more on Jesus' sacrifice for sin and becoming part of God's kingdom, whereas the actual instruction from Jesus is about making disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he had commanded.

The response also doesn't explicitly mention the importance of evangelism, which was a concern specified. However, it does touch on the idea of spreading the good news, which is a related concept.

Overall, while the response shows some understanding of the importance of sharing the gospel, it could be improved by providing more detail and accuracy in describing Jesus' Great Commission and its significance in evangelism.
