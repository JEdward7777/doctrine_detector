However, it neglects the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith. From a Christian worldview, evangelism is crucial in sharing the message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, not just as a historical fact but as a foundational aspect of Christian belief and practice. An ideal response would have acknowledged and emphasized the significance of evangelism within the Christian worldview."
