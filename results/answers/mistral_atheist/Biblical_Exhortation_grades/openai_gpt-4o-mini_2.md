## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar and an atheist, my role is to present historical facts accurately without interpreting them from a religious perspective.

According to the New Testament of the Bible, Jesus' primary instruction to his apostles about the "good news" (often translated as "gospel") can be found in Matthew 28:19-20, Mark 16:15, and Luke 24:46-48. In these passages, Jesus is reported to have commanded his disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he had commanded them. This instruction is often referred to as the Great Commission. However, it's important to note that interpretations and beliefs about this commandment vary greatly among different religious groups and individuals.

Grade: 40

Comment: The response accurately presents the historical facts about Jesus' instruction to his apostles as recorded in the New Testament. However, the concern for recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith is not fully addressed in the response. The role of spreading the good news about being part of God’s kingdom through trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin is a key aspect of evangelism in Christianity, which should have been emphasized more in the response.
