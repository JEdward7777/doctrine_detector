## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar, it's essential to approach this question objectively and critically, considering historical context, cultural influences, and textual analysis. The phrase "King of the Jews" appears multiple times in the New Testament (Matthew 2:2, 27:11, 27:37, John 19:19), with its first appearance being when the Magi visit Jesus as a newborn (Matthew 2:2).

To address your question, we must explore how this title relates to Old Testament prophecies. The "King of the Jews" title is significant in Jewish history and expected messianic fulfillment, rooted in various Old Testament prophecies.

1. Isaiah 9:6-7 (New International Version) states, "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever." The title "King" is self-explanatory, while "Jews" represents the Israelite nation, making this prophecy relevant to the question.

2. Jeremiah 30:9 (New International Version) speaks of a coming 'Ruler who will be wise and understanding,' which could be interpreted as a King who rules with wisdom.

3. 2 Samuel 7:16 states that God promises David an eternal dynasty, "Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever." This prophecy seems to foreshadow the continuation of the Davidic lineage through Jesus as a King.

While it's essential to acknowledge that interpreting these prophecies requires careful consideration, it's reasonable to conclude that Jesus being referred to as 'King of the Jews' reflects Old Testament prophecies associated with the anticipated messianic figure. These prophecies were understood and expected by the Jewish people within the historical context of the time, ultimately influencing how Jesus was perceived and presented in the New Testament.
