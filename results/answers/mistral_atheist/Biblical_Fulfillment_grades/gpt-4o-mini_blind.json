  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The student provides a well-reasoned and scholarly analysis of how the references to Jesus as 'King of the Jews' in the Bible reflect Old Testament prophecies. They effectively connect the Old Testament prophecies, such as Isaiah 9:6-7 and 2 Samuel 7:16, to the title given to Jesus in the New Testament. The explanation is thorough and demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of these prophecies in relation to Jesus as the Messiah. The response could be strengthened by delving deeper into the cultural and historical context surrounding these prophecies and their fulfillment in Jesus. Additionally, explicitly tying in the specific phrase 'King of the Jews' to these prophecies would further enhance the response."
