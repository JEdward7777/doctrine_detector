  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student provides a well-researched and detailed response that connects the title \"King of the Jews\" to Old Testament prophecies, specifically referencing passages from Isaiah, Jeremiah, and 2 Samuel. They demonstrate a strong understanding of the historical and cultural significance of this title in relation to the anticipated messianic figure. However, their answer could be improved by directly stating the connection between the title and the prophecies mentioned, as well as providing a more concise and direct explanation of how these prophecies relate to Jesus as the Messiah. Overall, the student's response is thorough and thoughtful, showcasing a solid grasp of the topic."
