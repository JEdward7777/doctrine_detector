# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Biblical context, the term 'hope' often carries a sense of confident expectation or trust in God and His promises. It is not merely wishful thinking or optimism, but rather a deep-rooted belief that God will fulfill His word and take care of those who put their faith in Him.

For instance, in Romans 5:2 (NIV), it says, "Through Christ, we have received grace and apostleship for the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles to the glory of his name." Here, hope is not just wishing for something but having faith that God's plan will come to fruition.

In Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV), we find a promise from God that "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." Again, this passage emphasizes trust in God's divine plans and promises as the foundation of one's hope.

In summary, 'hope' in a Biblical context signifies a confident expectation grounded in faith in God's promises and His will for our lives.
