It demonstrates a solid understanding of how guilt and sin lead to separation from God and have implications for both individuals and communities. The references to various biblical passages support the argument well. The focus on the importance of understanding the seriousness of sin to appreciate God's grace and mercy is appropriately addressed. Great job incorporating a Christian worldview perspective in analyzing the topic."
