  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible verses that depict God's majesty and recognized the interpretation of these verses in various Christian traditions. However, the student missed some key verses referenced in the teacher's answer, which could have strengthened their response and shown a deeper understanding of God's majestic nature as highlighted in the concern. Overall, a solid effort, but could benefit from including more specific verses referenced in the teacher's answer."
