## [Answer](../Biblical_References_2.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a neutral entity without personal beliefs, I don't interpret or emphasize any religious texts but I can certainly provide verses from the Bible that are often interpreted as depicting God's majesty:

1. Psalm 8:1 (NIV) - "Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!"
2. Isaiah 40:25-26 (NIV) - "To whom will you compare me or make an equation? Who has been my equal?" says the Holy One. Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these stars? He who brings out their host by number, calling them each by name, by greatness of his might and strength of his powerâ€”not one is missing."
3. Job 38:4-7 (NIV) - "Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand. Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it? On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?"
4. Daniel 4:3 (NIV) - "He reveals deep and mysterious things and knows what lies hidden in darkness, though he is surrounded by light."
5. Revelation 4:11 (NIV) - "You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being."

These verses illustrate a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur associated with the concept of God's majesty in various Christian traditions. However, interpretations can vary among different religious communities and scholars.
