  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides five Bible references that illustrate God's majesty, which aligns with the concern of connecting scripture with understanding God's majestic nature. The verses chosen are relevant and accurate in depicting God's grandeur, majesty, and power. The fact that they are often interpreted as such is also acknowledged, showing an awareness of the diversity of interpretations.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the response doesn't explicitly connect the scriptures provided with the concept of God's majesty. While it's implied, it would be even more effective if the writer had made some explicit connections between the verses and the idea of God's majestic nature.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively provides relevant scripture to support understanding God's majesty."
