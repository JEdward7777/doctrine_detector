  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good selection of Bible verses that illustrate the concept of God's majesty, offering a variety of perspectives on this attribute. However, it falls short of a higher grade as it does not effectively explain the connection between the specific verses cited and the understanding of God's majestic nature. More elaboration on how each verse highlights God's majesty would have strengthened the response."
