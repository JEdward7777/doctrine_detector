The inclusion of Daniel 7:13-14, Daniel 12:2-3, Isaiah 9:6-7, Psalm 2:7-9, and Ezekiel 34:23-24 demonstrates a good understanding of the prophetic passages. The explanation of how these passages contribute to the understanding of the messianic hope is clear and coherent. Additionally, the acknowledgment of varying interpretations adds a nuanced perspective to the discussion. Overall, a well-rounded response with good theological insight."
