The explanations were clear and connected well to the messianic role of Jesus in the New Testament. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the specific references from the teacher's provided answer, such as Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel, to strengthen the link between the Old and New Testaments in understanding Jesus as the messianic 'Son of Man.'"
