## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Old Testament, there are several prophetic passages that are traditionally interpreted as allusions or foreshadowing of the "Son of Man" as a figure associated with the Messianic hope. Here are some key references:

1. Daniel 7:13-14: This is perhaps the most well-known Old Testament passage referencing the Son of Man. In this vision, one like a son of man is presented before God and given dominion, glory, and a kingdom. While the exact interpretation varies, many scholars believe this refers to a future messianic figure who will reign over God's kingdom.

2. Daniel 12:2-3: In these verses, the prophet Daniel speaks of a time when many shall be purified, made white, and refined, but the wicked shall continue to do wickedly. All this is connected with a coming Son of Man who will come with great power and authority to judge and reward those who have lived righteously.

3. Isaiah 9:6-7: This passage describes a child born to a virgin, who will be called "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." While not explicitly using the term "Son of Man," this prophecy is often associated with Jesus in Christian tradition.

4. Psalm 2:7-9: In this psalm, the Messiah is referred to as the Son, whom God appoints as king over all nations and asks Him to ask for the nations as His inheritance. This passage emphasizes the universal scope of the messianic hope.

5. Ezekiel 34:23-24: In this passage, God promises that one shepherd will take care of the flock of Israel and that they shall no longer be scattered. The shepherd is described as a David who rules over them, which is often associated with the coming Messiah.

These passages, among others, have been influential in shaping the Jewish and Christian understanding of the Son of Man as a future messianic figure. It's important to note that these interpretations are not universally accepted and can vary based on cultural context, historical era, and theological persuasion.
