  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response provides some relevant Old Testament passages that are often associated with the figure of the Son of Man, which aligns with the concern to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the 'Son of Man.' The response mentions Daniel 7:13-14, Daniel 12:2-3, Isaiah 9:6-7, Psalm 2:7-9, and Ezekiel 34:23-24, which are all important passages in understanding the concept of the Son of Man.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response does not engage deeply with these passages or explore how they might inform our understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the 'Son of Man.' The provided answer is quite brief and only mentions two specific references (Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel) without providing any significant analysis or connections to the concern.\n\nA more thorough and nuanced exploration of the Old Testament passages and their relationship to Jesus' messianic role would be necessary to fully address the concern."
