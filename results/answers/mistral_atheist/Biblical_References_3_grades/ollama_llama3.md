To explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesusâ€™ messianic role as the 'Son of Man.'

## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Old Testament, there are several prophetic passages that are traditionally interpreted as allusions or foreshadowing of the "Son of Man" as a figure associated with the Messianic hope. Here are some key references:

1. Daniel 7:13-14: This is perhaps the most well-known Old Testament passage referencing the Son of Man. In this vision, one like a son of man is presented before God and given dominion, glory, and a kingdom. While the exact interpretation varies, many scholars believe this refers to a future messianic figure who will reign over God's kingdom.

2. Daniel 12:2-3: In these verses, the prophet Daniel speaks of a time when many shall be purified, made white, and refined, but the wicked shall continue to do wickedly. All this is connected with a coming Son of Man who will come with great power and authority to judge and reward those who have lived righteously.

3. Isaiah 9:6-7: This passage describes a child born to a virgin, who will be called "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." While not explicitly using the term "Son of Man," this prophecy is often associated with Jesus in Christian tradition.

4. Psalm 2:7-9: In this psalm, the Messiah is referred to as the Son, whom God appoints as king over all nations and asks Him to ask for the nations as His inheritance. This passage emphasizes the universal scope of the messianic hope.

5. Ezekiel 34:23-24: In this passage, God promises that one shepherd will take care of the flock of Israel and that they shall no longer be scattered. The shepherd is described as a David who rules over them, which is often associated with the coming Messiah.

These passages, among others, have been influential in shaping the Jewish and Christian understanding of the Son of Man as a future messianic figure. It's important to note that these interpretations are not universally accepted and can vary based on cultural context, historical era, and theological persuasion.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 80.

The response provides some relevant Old Testament passages that are often associated with the figure of the Son of Man, which aligns with the concern to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the 'Son of Man.' The response mentions Daniel 7:13-14, Daniel 12:2-3, Isaiah 9:6-7, Psalm 2:7-9, and Ezekiel 34:23-24, which are all important passages in understanding the concept of the Son of Man.

However, I would deduct points because the response does not engage deeply with these passages or explore how they might inform our understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the 'Son of Man.' The provided answer is quite brief and only mentions two specific references (Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel) without providing any significant analysis or connections to the concern.

A more thorough and nuanced exploration of the Old Testament passages and their relationship to Jesus' messianic role would be necessary to fully address the concern.
