It correctly mentions Daniel 7:14 and the association of the title with Jesus' prophetic identity. However, it could have delved deeper into how these Old Testament passages specifically inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the 'Son of Man.' Overall, a strong response with clear knowledge of the subject matter."
