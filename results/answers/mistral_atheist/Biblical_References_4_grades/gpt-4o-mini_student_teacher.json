  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of biblical passages where \"Lord\" is used in reference to God, illustrating His authority and attributes. However, the student could have included more concise examples that directly align with the concern provided by referencing Psalms 86:15-17, Matthew 7:21-23, and Philippians 2:9-11. Overall, a strong effort in demonstrating the understanding of God's authority as Lord through biblical references."
