# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 Absolutely! In the Bible, the term "Lord" (Hebrew: Adonai; Greek: Kurios) is commonly used to refer to God. Here are some examples where this term appears in both the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament:

1. Exodus 3:14 - In this passage, Moses encounters God at the burning bush, and God identifies Himself as "I AM WHO I AM" (Ehyeh asher ehyeh in Hebrew), later translated as Yahweh, which is often translated as "the LORD."

2. Deuteronomy 10:17 - In this verse, God is described as "the LORD who is God, the LORD alone, possessor of heavens and earth, who does not preside over wind or rain, but whose name is invoked in all that he wills." (Deut. 10:17, JPS 1917 Tanach)

3. Psalm 23 - This well-known psalm refers to God as "the LORD" throughout, emphasizing His role as shepherd, provider, and protector.

4. Isaiah 40:28 - In this passage, God's power and wisdom are highlighted when it says, "Do you not know? Do you not hear? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable."

5. Matthew 26:40 - In the New Testament, when Jesus' disciples fall asleep in Gethsemane before His arrest, Jesus says to them, "So, could you men not keep watch with me for one hour? Watch and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." Here, "the LORD" is used in reference to God.

6. John 20:16 - After Jesus' resurrection, Mary Magdalene encounters Him and says, "Teacher," which is translated from the Greek word "Rabboni," but in some versions of the Bible, it is translated as "Master" or "Lord."

These examples demonstrate how the term "Lord" (Adonai/Kurios) is used throughout the Bible to refer to God.
