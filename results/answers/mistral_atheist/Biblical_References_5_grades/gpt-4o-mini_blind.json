It correctly references relevant passages in the New Testament and articulates the symbolism of unleavened bread in both the Jewish Passover celebration and Christian sacraments. The student could enhance their response by further elaborating on the theological significance of Christ as the Passover Lamb and how His sacrifice fulfills the Old Testament typology. Additionally, integrating a deeper exploration of the theological implications of the removal of sin through the symbolism of unleavened bread would strengthen the response."
