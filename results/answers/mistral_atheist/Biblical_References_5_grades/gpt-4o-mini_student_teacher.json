  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation connecting the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings, particularly focusing on its significance during the Last Supper and its symbolism in the Passover celebration. The student referenced relevant biblical passages and explained their significance well. However, the teacher's reference answer narrows down the focus to 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, which directly relates unleavened bread to removing sin from the church. While the student's response covered more aspects of the topic, the specific focus of the concern was on identifying this particular text."
