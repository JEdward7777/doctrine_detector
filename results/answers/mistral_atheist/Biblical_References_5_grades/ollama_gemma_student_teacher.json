They provide detailed references from the New Testament and explain the symbolic significance of unleavened bread in both the Last Supper and the Exodus narrative. Additionally, the student connects the use of unleavened bread in Christian practices to themes of deliverance, sin, and new beginnings, which aligns with the Christian worldview. The reference to 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 further strengthens the student's argument by highlighting the connection between the removal of sin and the use of unleavened bread in Christian life and purity."
