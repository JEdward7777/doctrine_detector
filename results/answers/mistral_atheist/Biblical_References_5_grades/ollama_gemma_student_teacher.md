## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The concept of unleavened bread in Christian teachings is most prominently connected through the observance of Passover, as detailed in the New Testament book of Exodus and further explained in the Gospels (Matthew 26:17-29, Mark 14:12-26, Luke 22:7-20, and John 13:1-38).

In these passages, Jesus celebrates the Last Supper with his disciples, which is traditionally believed to have taken place on the Passover eve. During this meal, Jesus instructed his followers to observe the bread and wine as symbols of his body and blood that would be sacrificed for their sins.

The unleavened bread specifically holds significance because it was a key element in the Jewish Passover celebration. Unleavened bread (or matzo) was used during the original Exodus event, when the Israelites left Egypt in haste and did not have time to let their bread rise with yeast (Exodus 12:8,39). This symbolizes the haste of the exodus and also the removal of sin from believers' lives, as Jesus explains during the Last Supper (1 Corinthians 5:7-8).

Throughout Christian history, unleavened bread has been used in various sacraments and rituals, most notably during Holy Communion or Eucharist. The continued use of this symbol reminds believers of Jesus' sacrifice, the Last Supper, and the exodus from Egypt, emphasizing themes of deliverance, sin, and new beginnings that are central to Christian teachings.
