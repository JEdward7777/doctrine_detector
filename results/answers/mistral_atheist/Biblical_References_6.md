## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In addressing your question, I will present several Bible passages that discuss the concept of resurrection from various perspectives within the Judeo-Christian tradition. The following verses represent a sample of the multifaceted narrative on this topic across different books:

1. Old Testament (Book of Daniel 12:2): "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt." This verse foretells the resurrection of both righteous and wicked individuals at the end of time.

2. Old Testament (Book of Isaiah 26:19): "Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is like the dew of light, and the earth will give birth to those long deceased." This passage speaks to the idea that God has the power to bring back the dead to life.

3. New Testament (Gospel of Matthew 27:52-53): "And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and coming out of the graves after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many." This account describes a supernatural event that took place during Jesus' crucifixion, where some saints were miraculously resurrected.

4. New Testament (Letter to the Corinthians 15:12-23): This passage is one of the most comprehensive discussions on the topic of resurrection in the New Testament. It underscores the importance of Christ's resurrection and demonstrates that if Jesus was not raised, the Christian faith has no foundation. The letter also suggests that all believers will be raised with a transformed body at the end of time.

These verses provide an overview of the Bible's teachings on resurrection across both testaments. They offer insights into the belief in the afterlife and the hope of eternal life for faithful individuals within the Judeo-Christian tradition.
