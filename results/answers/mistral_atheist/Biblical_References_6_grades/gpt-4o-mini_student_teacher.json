  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive and well-structured response citing relevant Bible verses from both the Old and New Testaments that discuss the concept of resurrection, the answer could be improved by including some of the specific verses mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Incorporating the verses mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:13, 1 Peter 3:21, Hebrews 11:35, John 5:28-29, and Luke 20:27 would have strengthened the student's answer and aligned it more closely with the reference answer. Additionally, the student effectively explained the significance of the passages they selected, showcasing a solid understanding of the concept of resurrection within the Christian faith."
