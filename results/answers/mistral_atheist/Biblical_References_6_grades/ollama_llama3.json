The selected verses provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic, highlighting God's power to bring back the dead to life, the importance of Christ's resurrection, and the hope of eternal life for believers. While the response does not specifically address the concern about focusing on scripture as the authoritative source for grounding beliefs and teachings, it does demonstrate a clear commitment to biblical authority by presenting relevant verses and providing an in-depth analysis of their meaning. Overall, the response is well-organized, informative, and effectively demonstrates an understanding of the Christian concept of resurrection."
