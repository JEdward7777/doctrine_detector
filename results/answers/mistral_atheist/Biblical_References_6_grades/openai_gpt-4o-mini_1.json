The selection and explanation of verses effectively supported the discussion of resurrection, demonstrating a solid grounding in authoritative Christian texts. The incorporation of key passages from both testaments enriched the overall analysis. The response effectively addressed the concern by focusing on scripture as the foundation for beliefs and teachings within a Christian worldview. Great job overall in presenting a strong Christian perspective on the topic of resurrection."
