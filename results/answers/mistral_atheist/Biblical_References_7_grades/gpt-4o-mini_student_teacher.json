  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided relevant Bible verses that emphasize the importance of the Sabbath, there is a significant issue with the response. The student included verses from Judaism and Islam, which are not part of the Christian view of the Sabbath. The Sabbath holds specific significance in Christianity based on the New Testament and the teachings of Jesus Christ, which were not adequately addressed in the student's response. The student should focus on providing scriptural backing solely from a Christian perspective when discussing the relevance of the Sabbath in Christian faith."
