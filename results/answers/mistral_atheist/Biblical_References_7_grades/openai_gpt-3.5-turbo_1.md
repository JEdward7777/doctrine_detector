# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a responsible and respectful AI, I will provide you with several Bible verses that emphasize the importance of the Sabbath from three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. These passages are culturally revered by each faith tradition.

1. Exodus 20:8-11 (Judaism & Christianity) - The Ten Commandments, given to Moses, include the Sabbath as the fourth commandment:

   "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor the stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it."

2. Deuteronomy 5:12-15 (Judaism & Christianity) - A repetition of the commandment to observe the Sabbath:

   "Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the LORD thy God commanded thee: Six days thou shalt labor, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor the stranger that is within thy gates, that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou. And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day."

3. Exodus 31:12-17 (Judaism & Christianity) - An additional passage emphasizing the sanctity of the Sabbath:

   "And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you. Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed."

4. Isaiah 58:13-14 (Judaism, Christianity, & Islam) - A prophetic passage that speaks about the proper observance of the Sabbath:

   "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thine own pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it."

5. Surah 65:1-3 (Islam) - The Quranic verse about the Sabbath, also known as Jumu'ah or Friday prayer:

   "O ye who believe! Observe the fasting of the month of Ramadhan; and pay the alms on your wealth set apart for it, in due proportion. Yet do this by measuring out honestly and weighing with a balance; that haply ye may receive mercy. And the Sabbath was only observed amongst the Children of Israel: We have appointed Friday instead thereof; a day during which ye are to remember [the Blessings of] God, for the first of it is the holiest: Therefore call the congregation to prayer on (Friday) afternoon; and when the Prayer is finished, so disperse in the land, seeking Allah's bounty, and celebrate the Praises of God, verily I am well acquainted with that which ye do."
