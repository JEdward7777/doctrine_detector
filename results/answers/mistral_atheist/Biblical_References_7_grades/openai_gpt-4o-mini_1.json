While the inclusion of the Quranic verse regarding Jumu'ah is interesting for comparison, the focus of the concern was on scriptural backing within the Christian faith. The response could have been strengthened by delving deeper into the New Testament teachings on Sabbath observance specifically within Christian doctrine. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the significance of the Sabbath in the Abrahamic traditions."
