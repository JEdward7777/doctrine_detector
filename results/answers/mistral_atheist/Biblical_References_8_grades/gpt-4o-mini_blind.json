  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid overview of Bible verses referencing the concept of ransom and its relationship with redemption. The examples given are relevant and explained appropriately. The student effectively connects the concept of ransom with humanity's need for redemption from sin. The only improvement would be to further elaborate on the doctrinal significance of the ransom and redemption through Jesus Christ, emphasizing the theological implications for Christian faith and salvation."
