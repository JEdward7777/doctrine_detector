## [Answer](../Biblical_References_8.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the New Testament of the Christian Bible, several passages refer to the concept of ransom and its relationship with redemption. Here are a few examples:

1. Mark 10:45 - "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." This verse is often interpreted to mean that Jesus came to earth to offer himself as a sacrifice (or ransom) to free humanity from sin.

2. 1 Timothy 2:5-6 - "For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all menâ€”the testimony given in its proper time." This passage emphasizes that Jesus is the only intermediary between God and humanity, and he gave his life as a ransom or redemption for all people.

3. Matthew 20:28 - "Even as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Similar to Mark 10:45, this verse reinforces that Jesus came to earth to offer himself as a sacrifice or ransom for the many.

These verses contribute to the understanding of redemption by suggesting that humanity was in bondage due to sin and required a ransom (or payment) to be freed from that bondage. By offering his life as a ransom, Jesus is seen as providing redemption or salvation for humanity. The cultural context in which these verses were written would have influenced the understanding of ransom and redemption, with slavery being a prominent institution at the time.
