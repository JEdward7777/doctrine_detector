  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 from a scholarly, atheistic perspective, focusing on historical context and cultural implications. However, the student missed the Christian worldview perspective by not emphasizing the significance of faith in Jesus Christ and the apostolic mission to include Gentiles in the Christian faith. The student's analysis would have been stronger if they had incorporated more Christian-specific teachings on grace and inclusion."
