  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible verses that offer insight into the concept of Heaven, addressing key aspects such as the preparation of a place by God, the description of the new heaven and new earth, and the promise of comfort and blessing for believers. The response acknowledges the diversity of interpretations among Christian denominations, which is a valuable point to consider. However, the student could have further elaborated on the theological significance of these verses and provided more context for a richer understanding of Heaven within Christian doctrine."
