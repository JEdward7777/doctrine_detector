## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Pentecost.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The Festival of Weeks, also known as Pentecost in Christian tradition, is significant in both the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and the New Testament.

In the Hebrew Bible:
1. Leviticus 23:15-21 provides the commandment for this festival, which is also called Shavuot or the Feast of Weeks. The passage specifies that it should be celebrated seven weeks (49 days) after the offering of the Omer on the second day of Passover.

2. In Numbers 28:26-31, the instructions for the grain and burnt offerings during Pentecost are detailed.

In the New Testament:
The Book of Acts (Acts 2:1) records the event known as the Pentecost in Christian tradition, which occurred on this Jewish festival, when the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples of Jesus. This event is significant for Christians as it marks the beginning of the Christian Church.
