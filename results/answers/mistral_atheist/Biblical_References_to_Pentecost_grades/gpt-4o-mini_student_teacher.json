They correctly identified the relevant passages from Leviticus, Numbers, and Acts. However, they missed references to the Festival of Weeks in 2 Chronicles and Deuteronomy as stated in the reference answer. It's crucial to include all relevant references for a comprehensive understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost."
