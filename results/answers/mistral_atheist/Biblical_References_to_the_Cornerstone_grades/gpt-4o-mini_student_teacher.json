  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses that reference Jesus as the cornerstone and explained their significance, they missed the opportunity to deepen believers' understanding by not explicitly connecting Jesus as the cornerstone to His significance in the faith. Encouraging further reflection on how these verses emphasize Jesus' essential role in the foundation of faith and the Church would have enhanced the response in line with the specified concern. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could have tied the verses more explicitly to Jesus' significance in the faith for a higher grade."
