  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive overview of the various biblical passages that refer to Jesus as the \"cornerstone.\" It includes a range of references from both the Old and New Testaments, which demonstrates a good understanding of the context and significance of these verses. The response also acknowledges the potential for varying interpretations among different religious groups and scholars.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more analysis and reflection on the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone in faith and the Church. While it provides some general statements about Jesus' role in the foundation of faith and the Church, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into what this means for believers and how it can be applied to daily life.\n\nOverall, I believe that this response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical passages and their significance, but could benefit from more analysis and application."
