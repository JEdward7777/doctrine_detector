 As a culturally responsive AI model, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations, but I can certainly help you understand religious texts from a scholarly perspective. In Christianity, Jesus is often symbolically referred to as the "cornerstone" in several verses across both the Old and New Testaments. Here are some key references:

1. Psalm 118:22 - "The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone." This verse from the Old Testament is often interpreted as a prophecy of Jesus, with the "cornerstone" symbolizing His role as the foundation of faith and the one upon whom salvation depends.

2. Isaiah 28:16 - "So I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and violence." In this verse, God refers to Jesus as a "cornerstone" in Isaiah's prophecy about salvation.

3. Matthew 21:42 - "Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the Scriptures: "'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?'" Here, Jesus applies Psalm 118:22 to himself, emphasizing His role as the cornerstone of faith.

4. Ephesians 2:20 - "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone." In this New Testament verse, Paul refers to Jesus as the cornerstone upon which the church is built.

5. 1 Peter 2:6-7 - "For in Scripture it says: 'See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.' Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,'" Peter references both Psalm 118:22 and Isaiah 28:16, emphasizing Jesus' role as a foundation for faith.

These verses collectively convey that Jesus is seen as the foundation of faith and the source of salvation in Christianity. However, interpretations may vary among different religious groups and scholars.
