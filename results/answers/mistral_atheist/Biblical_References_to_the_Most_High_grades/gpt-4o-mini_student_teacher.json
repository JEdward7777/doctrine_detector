  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive response with multiple relevant Bible verses that highlight God as the \"Most High\" and discussed His character traits effectively. However, they could have included the reference answer's verses (Psalm 83:18 and Daniel 4:17) to further enhance the depth of their analysis. Additionally, the student's explanation of the verses they chose could have delved deeper into the significance of God's sovereignty and authority over all creation. Overall, a strong effort in exploring the topic through Scripture and reflecting on God's character attributes."
