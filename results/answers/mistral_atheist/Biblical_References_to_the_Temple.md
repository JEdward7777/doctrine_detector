## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Judaism, the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) contains several references to the Temple as the "House of Yahweh." The Temple is mentioned in various books, including Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, 1 Kings, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Ezekiel. Some specific passages include:

* Exodus 25:8 - "And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them."
* 1 Kings 8:13 - "I have surely built You an exalted house, a place for You to dwell forever."
* Ezekiel 43:7 - "And every man of the house of Israel shall know that the water source of the sanctuary is from under the threshold of the temple of the LORD, from below the altar on the north side; and he will take there water for ablution. But the priests who are within my sanctuary, they may bathe their flesh with the water."
* Ezekiel 48:11 - "These shall be to them as a threshing floor forever, and the produce of the threshing floor shall not come up to the corners of it; rather the corners of it shall be common property for the priests. This is the contribution of the Levites from the border of 25,000 cubits around the temple."

These verses demonstrate that the Temple was considered a sacred place where God would dwell among His people according to Jewish scripture.
