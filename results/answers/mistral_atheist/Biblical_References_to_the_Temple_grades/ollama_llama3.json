  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides several relevant scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple in relation to God's house, demonstrating an understanding of the significance of the Temple as the \"House of Yahweh\" in Jewish scripture. However, the response does not fully answer the concern, as it only references a few specific verses and does not provide a comprehensive overview of the various scriptures that discuss the concept.\n\nTo improve, the response could have included more passages from different books of the Hebrew Bible to demonstrate a broader understanding of the temple's importance in Jewish scripture. Additionally, some analysis or explanation of why these passages are significant for understanding the concept of God's house would have been helpful."
