  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear reference to key scriptures, including 1 Kings 8:44 and 2 Chronicles 6:4, that discuss the temple as the \"house of Yahweh.\" The additional mention of \"other verses in the content\" shows an understanding of the broader context of the concept. However, it could have been strengthened by incorporating more specific verses or explanations from the content to further support the discussion. Overall, a solid response with room for further elaboration."
