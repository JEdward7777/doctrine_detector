  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a strong overview of the term \"woe\" in the Bible and its significance in conveying God's judgment. The student effectively references relevant verses from both the Old Testament and the New Testament, offering insightful interpretations of each passage. The analysis demonstrates an understanding of the theological implications of God's judgment upon disobedience and mistreatment of others. To improve, the student could include more direct references to the consequences of God's judgment beyond the use of the term \"woe\" and delve deeper into the theological implications within a Christian worldview."
