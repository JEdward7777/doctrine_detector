  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided thorough and insightful examples of the use of \"woe\" in the Bible to illustrate God's judgment. They offered detailed interpretations of each passage, highlighting God's displeasure with disobedience and mistreatment of others. The student effectively connected the use of \"woe\" to the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. However, the reference answer from the teacher included additional relevant examples that the student did not cover, which slightly decreases the overall grade."
