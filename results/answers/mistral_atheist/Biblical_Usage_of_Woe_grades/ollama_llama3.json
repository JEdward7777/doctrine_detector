  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern of examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture, providing multiple examples from various biblical books to demonstrate God's strong condemnation and lamentation when His people disobey Him or harm others. The explanation is clear and concise, allowing the reader to understand the significance of the term \"woe\" in these passages.\n\nThe response also provides a coherent and logical connection between the different examples, highlighting the theme of God's judgment on those who disobey Him and harm others. The use of specific biblical references helps to ground the discussion in scriptural authority, adding credibility to the analysis.\n\nHowever, I would deduct 15 points because this response does not explicitly address the concern or directly respond to the provided answer. While the examples given are relevant and well-explained, they do not necessarily align with the provided answer, which mentioned specific verses (Ezekiel 13:17-18, Habakkuk 2:12, and Matthew 23:23). A more explicit connection between the provided answer and the response's analysis would have strengthened the overall grade."
