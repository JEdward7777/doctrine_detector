  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively builds upon the provided answer by offering additional examples from the Bible that illustrate the seriousness of divine judgment expressed through the use of the term \"woe.\" The examples provided, along with their interpretations, demonstrate a consistent theme of God's condemnation of sin and mistreatment of others, aligning well with the concern of examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. The response shows a strong understanding of how the concept of \"woe\" serves as a warning of God's judgment towards those who deviate from His will and harm others."
