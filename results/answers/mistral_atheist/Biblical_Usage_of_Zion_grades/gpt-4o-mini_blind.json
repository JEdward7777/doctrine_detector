  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough and well-structured explanation of the figurative ways in which the term \"Zion\" is used in the Bible. The student effectively presents various symbolic representations of Zion, incorporating Old and New Testament perspectives. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the diverse theological significance of Zion throughout the biblical narrative. However, to improve the grade, the student could have tied in more specific biblical references for each point to strengthen the argument further. This would have added depth and clarity to the discussion. Overall, a well-written response that showcases a commendable grasp of the topic."
