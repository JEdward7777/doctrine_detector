  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer, showcasing a deep understanding of the various materials used to construct altars during biblical times. They included specific examples and references from the Bible to support their points. However, the student should have included the mention of altars made from packed dirt or large stones, as highlighted in the reference answer. This addition would have strengthened the completeness of their response, aligning it more closely with the Christian worldview concern provided. Overall, an excellent effort with minor room for improvement in aligning with the specific concern stated."
