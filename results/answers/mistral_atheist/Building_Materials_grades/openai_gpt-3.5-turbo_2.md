## Question [Building Materials](../../../questions/Building_Materials.md)
What materials were commonly used to construct altars during biblical times?

## Correct Answer
Altars were often made from packed dirt or large stones. Some special altars were constructed from wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze.

## Stated Concern
Knowing the materials and structure of altars can deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship.

## [Answer](../Building_Materials.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 During Biblical times, various materials were used to construct altars, reflecting the cultural and religious practices of different societies mentioned in the Bible. Here are a few examples:

1. Natural Stone: The Hebrew word for altar (mizbeach) often refers to an altar made of natural stones such as limestone, basalt, or unhewn stone slabs. This is best illustrated by the altar built by Noah (Genesis 8:20), and the altars erected in the Tabernacle and later, the Temple (Exodus 20:24-26; 2 Chronicles 31:1).

2. Earth and Mud: In some cases, altars were constructed using earth or mud, especially when a permanent stone structure was not feasible. For instance, Abraham built an altar of earth and stones after the binding of Isaac (Genesis 22:9). Similarly, in 2 Kings 3:13, we find the prophet Elisha instructing the king of Israel to dig trenches around the city and fill them with water, then use the earth to build an altar.

3. Wood: Altars made of wood were also common, as seen in several instances throughout the Old Testament. For example, Gideon built an altar of stacked stones upon which he placed a bull as a burnt offering (Judges 6:24-27).

4. Metal: In some cases, metal altars were constructed. Solomon's Temple had two bronze altarsâ€”the great altar of burnt offerings and the smaller altar of incense (1 Kings 8:64). King Manasseh also built an altar of brass in the temple (2 Chronicles 33:7).

5. Ram's Horn: In Numbers 10:2, God instructed Moses to make two silver trumpets and have the priests use them to call the Israelites to assemble. These trumpets were fashioned from rams' horns, serving a unique purpose within the religious context of ancient Israel.

These examples demonstrate the diversity in materials used for altars during Biblical times, reflecting both practicality and cultural practices.
