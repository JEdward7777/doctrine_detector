It would have been more thorough if it also mentioned other materials like earth, mud, and ram's horns that were used for constructing altars, as shown in the detailed response. Understanding the variety of materials used for altars in the Bible can indeed deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship."
