In a Christian worldview, the primary command given to believers for personal sanctification is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:3, which states, \"For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality.\" The answer would have been greatly improved by including this specific biblical command related to personal sanctification in the Christian faith."
