## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of many religions, there's a common emphasis on personal sanctification, often through adherence to certain moral and ethical guidelines. Here are some examples from major world religions:

1. Christianity: In the New Testament, Jesus teaches his followers to "love your neighbor as yourself" (Matthew 22:39) and to strive for holiness (Matthew 5:48). Paul in his letter to the Romans (12:2) advises believers to "be transformed by the renewing of [their] mind."

2. Islam: In the Quran, believers are instructed to "We have enjoined on man kindness to parents; but if they strive (to force) you to join with Me something (in worship) of which you have no knowledge, obey them not" (Quran 29:8). Muslims are also encouraged to purify their souls and strive towards righteousness.

3. Buddhism: The First Precept for Buddhist practitioners is the refrain from taking life. This includes both killing animals and humans. Other precepts involve refraining from theft, sexual misconduct, lying, intoxicants which lead to carelessness, and eating at inappropriate times.

4. Hinduism: In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna instructs Arjuna on the path of Dharma (righteousness), which includes self-discipline, control of the senses, purification of the mind, and performing one's duties without attachment to the results.

These examples illustrate how different religions emphasize various aspects of personal sanctification. However, it's important to remember that interpretations of these teachings can vary widely among followers of each religion.

Comments: The answer provided a good overview of how different religions emphasize personal sanctification; however, it did not specifically address the question regarding the command given to believers in Christianity regarding their personal sanctification. In a Christian worldview, the primary command given to believers for personal sanctification is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:3, which states, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality." The answer would have been greatly improved by including this specific biblical command related to personal sanctification in the Christian faith.
