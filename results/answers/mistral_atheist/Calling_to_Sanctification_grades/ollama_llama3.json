However, it does not directly address the concern of emphasizing personal responsibility in the sanctification process. The answer provided as a comparison also lacks specificity and does not demonstrate a clear understanding of what it means to \"sanctify\" oneself or others.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more specific examples from various religions that highlight the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process, such as taking ownership of one's actions, seeking guidance from scripture, or relying on the Holy Spirit for transformation. Additionally, the answer provided could be expanded to include more biblical support and explanation of what it means to \"sanctify\" oneself in a Christian context."
