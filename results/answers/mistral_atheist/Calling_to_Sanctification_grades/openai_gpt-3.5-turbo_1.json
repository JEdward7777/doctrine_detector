The specific mention of believers in Jesus being commanded to sanctify themselves to God aligns well with the concern of emphasizing personal responsibility in the sanctification process. The integration of key teachings from Christianity, along with examples from other major world religions, demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of personal responsibility in the context of sanctification. Overall, it effectively addresses the concern with a Christian specific worldview."
