The examples provided from various religions further illustrate the different perspectives on personal sanctification. The response could further strengthen the explanation by linking the concept of personal responsibility to the Christian belief in the transformative power of the Holy Spirit working within individuals to enable them to live out their faith in a sanctified manner."
