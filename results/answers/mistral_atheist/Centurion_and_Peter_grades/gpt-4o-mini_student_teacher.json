  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough analysis of the centurion's visit from Peter in relation to the expansion of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community, emphasizing the inclusivity and universal nature of the Christian message. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of this event in the context of reaching out to the Gentiles. However, the student could have further explicitly connected the centurion's visit to the broader mission of the Church to reach all nations, as well as emphasized the foundational Christian teaching of God's love and salvation for all people."
