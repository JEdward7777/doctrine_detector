## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In ancient Jewish society, the Temple in Jerusalem served as the religious and cultural center of the Jewish people, and the priesthood played a crucial role in its administration. The priestly system was divided into two main groups: the high priests (Kohanim Gadolim) and the ordinary priests (Kohanim Ketanim).

The high priest held the highest rank among the priests and served as the spiritual leader of the Jewish people. He was responsible for performing various rituals, such as offering sacrifices on behalf of the nation and interceding with God. The high priest was appointed from amongst the descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses, who were considered to be the founding family of the priesthood.

The ordinary priests, also known as Levites, performed a variety of tasks in the Temple, including maintaining order, assisting with sacrifices, and singing in the choir. While they did not hold the same level of authority as the high priest, they played an essential role in the proper functioning of religious rituals and ceremonies.

In terms of authority, the relationship between the high priests and ordinary priests was hierarchical. The high priest had ultimate authority over religious matters, while the ordinary priests were responsible for carrying out his instructions. However, it is important to note that this hierarchy did not mean that the ordinary priests were subservient or powerless; they held significant status within Jewish society and played essential roles in maintaining the religious system of ancient Israel.

It's worth noting that this relationship was influenced by the political context of the time. During periods of Jewish independence, such as during the Second Temple period, the high priest's authority would have been more substantial. Conversely, during periods of foreign rule, such as under Roman occupation, the high priests may have had less direct influence over religious affairs.
