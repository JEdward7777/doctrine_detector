  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response accurately describes the hierarchical relationship between high priests and ordinary priests in ancient Israel, with the high priest holding the most authority. The description of the high priest's role as spiritual leader and performer of rituals is also correct.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. Firstly, while it mentions that the high priest was appointed from amongst the descendants of Aaron, it does not elaborate on the significance of this fact in terms of authority and legitimacy. Additionally, the response could benefit from more detail on the specific responsibilities and roles of ordinary priests.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel, but could be further developed to provide a more comprehensive picture."
