# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The term "Christ" originates from the Greek translation of the Hebrew term "Mashiach" or Messiah, which means "anointed one." In the Old Testament, it was used to refer to a future Jewish leader who would be anointed by God and would usher in God's kingdom on earth.

In the New Testament, the term "Christ" is applied to Jesus of Nazareth, who was considered by his followers to be the promised Messiah. The term appears more than 500 times in the New Testament, with varying uses and interpretations.

At first usage, it is often translated as "anointed one," reflecting its original meaning from the Old Testament. However, as the narrative unfolds, the concept of Christ takes on a broader, more spiritual significance. For example, in Matthew 1:16-17, Jesus is called "Jesus Christ" or "Jesus the Messiah," emphasizing his role as the promised savior.

Later in the New Testament, the term "Christ" comes to symbolize Jesus' divine nature and his role as the Son of God. In John 1:41, for example, when Andrew introduces his brother Simon Peter to Jesus, he says, "We have found the Messiah" (which is translated as "Christ" in some versions). This exchange implies that Jesus is not only a human anointed by God but also God himself.

Throughout the New Testament, the term "Christ" thus evolves from a designation of a future Jewish leader to a title denoting Jesus' unique role as the promised Messiah and Son of God. This evolution reflects the changing understanding and interpretation of who Jesus was and his significance for humanity.
