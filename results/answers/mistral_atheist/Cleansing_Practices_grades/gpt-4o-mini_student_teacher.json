  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive response by offering various interpretations and modern adaptations of Old Testament practices related to ritual cleanliness. They effectively connected these adaptations to contemporary Christian practices and beliefs. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing a more direct link between the practices mentioned and the concept of seeking a state of moral and spiritual cleanliness, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and provided thoughtful insights."
