  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively discusses how modern Christians can adopt practices like repentance, confession, and spiritual discipline to symbolize moral and spiritual cleanliness, drawing parallels to Old Testament rituals. The interpretation aligns with the concern by highlighting how incorporating ancient teachings into contemporary faith practice can enhance spiritual growth and accountability. The response could have been strengthened by providing more specific examples or biblical references to support the argument further. Overall, well done in addressing the concern with a Christian worldview perspective."
