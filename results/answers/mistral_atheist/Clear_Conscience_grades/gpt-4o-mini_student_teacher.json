  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of what it means to have a clear conscience in the context of Christian teachings. They have referenced a relevant scripture and discussed the importance of maintaining a clear conscience for spiritual health and alignment with God's will. However, the student could improve their answer by emphasizing the aspect of obedience to God as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Strengthening the connection between clear conscience, obedience, and alignment with God's will would enhance the overall response."
