  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the concept of a \"clear conscience\" within Christian teachings. It clearly defines the state of freedom from guilt and remorse, while emphasizing the importance of living a virtuous life and seeking forgiveness. The inclusion of a biblical reference further reinforces the authenticity of the response. The only area for improvement would be to elaborate on the concept of diverse interpretations among Christian denominations."
