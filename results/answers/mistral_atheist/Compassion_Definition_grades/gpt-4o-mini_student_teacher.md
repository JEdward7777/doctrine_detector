## [Answer](../Compassion_Definition.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, compassion (often translated from the Hebrew word "rachamim" or Greek word "splagchnizomai") is a deep emotion that involves empathy, love, and kindness towards others who are suffering. It's not just about feeling sorry for someone; it also involves taking action to alleviate their suffering.

Here are some examples of compassionate actions in the Bible:

1. Showing mercy and forgiveness: In the Old Testament, God shows compassion by forgiving the sins of his people (Exodus 34:6-7). Jesus also emphasizes forgiveness as a key aspect of compassion (Matthew 18:21-35).

2. Caring for the poor and oppressed: In Deuteronomy 15:7-8, God commands his people to care for the poor and needy among them, saying "If there is among you a poor man, one of your brothers, in any of your towns in your land which the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother."

3. Showing kindness to strangers: The Bible encourages hospitality and compassion towards strangers, as they are often seen as representations of God himself (Genesis 18:1-8; Matthew 25:35).

4. Acts of charity and generosity: In Luke 3:11, John the Baptist calls on his followers to share their clothes with those who have none, and in Acts 20:35, Paul tells the elders of the church at Ephesus that it is more blessed to give than to receive.

5. Visiting the sick and imprisoned: James 1:27 says that true religion involves caring for orphans and widows in their distress and visiting those who are sick or in prison.

6. Caring for animals: In Proverbs 12:10, it is said that a righteous person cares about the welfare of their animals, while the wicked pay no heed to them.

Overall, compassion in the Bible involves caring for those in need, showing mercy and forgiveness, and acting with kindness and generosity towards others. It's not just about feeling empathy, but also about taking action to alleviate suffering and make a positive impact on the world around us.
