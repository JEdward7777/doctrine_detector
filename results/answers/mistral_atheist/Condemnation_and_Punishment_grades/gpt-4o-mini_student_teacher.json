  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful analysis of the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22, demonstrating an understanding of how they shape our perspective on punishment. The student effectively discussed the themes of mercy, compassion, and redemption present in the verses and their implications for our understanding of divine justice and punishment. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of balancing divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment, as specified in the concern. Overall, a solid response with room for slight improvement in addressing the specified concern."
