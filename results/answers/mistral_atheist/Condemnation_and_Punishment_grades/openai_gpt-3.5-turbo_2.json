  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 in relation to the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. It effectively highlights the importance of mercy and redemption in the Christian worldview and how punishment can be viewed as an opportunity for growth and restoration rather than solely condemnation. The explanation is well-supported and aligns with Christian teachings on forgiveness and compassion. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly emphasize the need for justice alongside mercy, as both are important aspects of God's character in Christian belief."
