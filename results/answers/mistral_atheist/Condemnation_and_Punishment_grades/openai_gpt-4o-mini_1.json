  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22, incorporating a Christian worldview perspective on divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment. It effectively highlights the importance of mercy and redemption in understanding punishment, but could have further emphasized the balance between divine justice and mercy in shaping our perspective on punishment. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern."
