  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding the relationship between confessing Jesus as Lord and being saved in Paul's writings. They correctly note the cultural context of Paul's use of the term \"Lord\" and tie it to submission and allegiance. The student effectively references relevant passages such as Romans 10:9 and accurately conveys the importance of both confession and belief in salvation. However, the answer could be improved by incorporating more direct quotes or references from Paul's writings to strengthen their argument and tie it more closely to the specific wording provided in the reference answer."
