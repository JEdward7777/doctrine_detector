  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thorough response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the relationship between confessing that Jesus is Lord and being saved according to Paul's writings. The student provides a clear explanation of the cultural context in which Paul wrote, and how his use of the term \"Lord\" reflects submission to Jesus as the spiritual ruler. The student also correctly identifies the importance of both verbal confession and belief in Jesus' resurrection for salvation."
