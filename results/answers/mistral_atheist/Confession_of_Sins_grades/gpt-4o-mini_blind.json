  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately references relevant Bible verses such as 1 Corinthians 10:13, Matthew 4:1-11, and 1 Corinthians 6:18 to provide guidance on how a Christian should respond to temptation. The emphasis on seeking God's guidance through prayer, Scripture reading, and fellowship with other believers is doctrinally sound. However, the student could improve by further emphasizing the role of reliance on God's strength through the Holy Spirit to overcome temptation. Overall, a solid response that aligns well with Christian beliefs."
