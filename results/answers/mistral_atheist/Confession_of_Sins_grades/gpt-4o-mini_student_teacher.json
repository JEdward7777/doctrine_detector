However, there is a notable absence of emphasis on the importance of confessing personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness, which was a specific concern in this case. Encouraging the acknowledgment of personal sin and seeking God's forgiveness should have been more pronounced in the response to align better with the Christian-specific worldview."
