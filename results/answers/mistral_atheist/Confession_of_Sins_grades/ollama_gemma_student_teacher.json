  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response adequately addresses the concern of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness. It references relevant biblical passages and provides a clear explanation of how a Christian should respond when tempted to sin. However, the response could benefit from explicitly mentioning the importance of confessing sins to God as an act of obedience and faith."
