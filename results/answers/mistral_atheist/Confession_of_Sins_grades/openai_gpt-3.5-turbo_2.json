  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed and well-supported explanation of how a Christian should handle temptation and sin based on Biblical references. The emphasis on seeking God's guidance, fleeing from temptation, and relying on God's strength aligns well with Christian beliefs. The additional emphasis on confession of sin and God's forgiveness could have been more explicitly stated in the response, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
