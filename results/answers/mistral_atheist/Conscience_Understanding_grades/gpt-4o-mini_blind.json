  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the biblical definition of conscience and its function according to Christian beliefs. They correctly highlight the guidance, custodial role, connection to sin, growth in wisdom, and judgment aspects of conscience in Christian theology. However, it would be beneficial for the student to include more specific biblical references to support their points and deepen the doctrinal foundation of their answer."
