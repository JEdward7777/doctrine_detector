  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75. While the student provides an insightful and comprehensive explanation of the concept of conscience according to Christian beliefs, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's response includes additional elaboration on the functions of conscience beyond what was directly asked in the question, which, while informative, may slightly detract from focusing solely on the biblical definition and function of conscience. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic, but could improve by directly aligning their response more closely with the reference answer."
