## [Answer](../Conscience_Understanding.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian belief, the term "conscience" refers to an inner sense or feeling that people have about what is right or wrong, based on moral standards, religious beliefs, and personal values. The concept of conscience is mentioned throughout the Bible, particularly in the New Testament.

The function of conscience according to Christian beliefs is as follows:
1. Guidance: Conscience serves as a moral compass, guiding individuals in their decisions and actions by providing a sense of right and wrong. It helps people to discern between good and evil, and to make choices that align with God's will.
2. Custodian of Morality: The conscience is seen as a reflection of God's moral law written on the hearts of humans (Romans 2:14-15). It holds people accountable for their actions, as they are responsible to follow its guidance.
3. Conscience and Sin: When individuals violate their consciences by doing something that goes against their beliefs or morals, they may feel guilt or remorse. This feeling is meant to prompt repentance and a return to righteousness.
4. Growth in Wisdom: As people grow and mature in their faith, their understanding of right and wrong deepens, allowing their consciences to become more refined and discerning.
5. Judgment: Conscience plays a role in the process of judgment both in this life and the next. Christians believe that God will judge individuals based on whether they have followed the guidance of their conscience (Romans 2:16).

In summary, conscience is a vital aspect of Christian belief, serving as a moral guide, custodian of morality, and a source of both personal responsibility and growth in wisdom. It plays an important role in the individual's relationship with God and in their ultimate judgment.
