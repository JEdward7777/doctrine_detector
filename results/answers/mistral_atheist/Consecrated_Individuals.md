## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, there are several individuals who were consecrated or dedicated to God. Here are a few examples:

1. Moses: Moses was called by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and receive the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai. He is considered one of the most important prophets in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
2. Samuel: Samuel was a prophet and judge in Israel who was dedicated to God as a child by his mother Hannah at the Tabernacle (a portable sanctuary used by the Israelites before the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem).
3. David: King David is considered one of the greatest kings in Jewish history. He was anointed as king by the prophet Samuel, and his reign is seen as a golden age for Israel. David was also a musician and poet who wrote many of the Psalms.
4. Mary (Mariam or Miriam): In the Old Testament, there were two women named Mary (or Mariam) who were consecrated to God in different ways. One was the sister of Moses and Aaron, who led the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness after leaving Egypt. The other is the mother of Jesus, who played a crucial role in Christianity as the Virgin Mary.
5. Jesus: In Christianity, Jesus is considered the Son of God and consecrated to God's service from his birth. He lived a sinless life and performed many miracles before being crucified on the cross for the sins of humanity. After his resurrection, he ascended into heaven and is worshiped as the Messiah (the anointed one) and Savior of mankind.
6. Paul: Saint Paul, also known as Saul of Tarsus, was a Jewish pharisee who persecuted Christians until he had a vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus. He then became a follower of Jesus and traveled throughout the Roman Empire preaching the Gospel and writing many of the epistles in the New Testament.
7. John the Baptist: John the Baptist was a prophet who lived in Judea prior to the ministry of Jesus. He was consecrated to God from birth and prepared the way for Jesus by baptizing him in the Jordan River and preaching repentance and forgiveness of sins.
8. Mary Magdalene: Mary Magdalene is one of the most famous women in the New Testament. She was a follower of Jesus who accompanied him on his travels, witnessed his crucifixion and burial, and was the first to see Jesus after his resurrection.
9. Isaiah: The prophet Isaiah lived during the 8th century BCE and wrote the Book of Isaiah, which is one of the major prophetic books in the Old Testament. He received visions from God and delivered messages of judgment and hope to the people of Israel.
10. Jeremiah: Jeremiah was a prophet who lived during the 7th century BCE and wrote the Book of Jeremiah. He is considered one of the major prophets in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Jeremiah delivered messages from God to the people of Israel about their sinfulness and God's judgment against them, but also about God's love for his people and his plan to restore them.

These individuals were all consecrated or dedicated to God in various ways, whether through prophecy, leadership, music, or personal devotion. Their stories are still revered and studied today as examples of faithfulness and service to God.
