  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a solid overview of what the Bible says about the consequences of pride and the importance of humility, supported by relevant passages from Proverbs, James, and Luke. They correctly highlighted the negative outcomes of pride and the positive traits associated with humility according to Christian doctrine. One suggestion for improvement would be to provide a bit more depth or insight into how these principles can be practically applied in daily life."
