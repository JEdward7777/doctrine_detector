  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the spiritual implications of pride versus humility by referencing relevant Bible passages. They have effectively highlighted the negative consequences of pride and the importance of humility as portrayed in those passages. The only area for improvement would be to provide a more concise and direct conclusion that reinforces the central theme of God humbling the proud and exalting the humble, as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer."
