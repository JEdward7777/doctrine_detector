## [Answer](../Consequences_of_Pride.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, pride is often portrayed as a significant sin that can lead to negative consequences, while humility is highly valued. Here are a few passages that illustrate this:

1. Proverbs 16:18 (NIV) - "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." This verse suggests that pride can lead to one's own downfall.

2. Proverbs 29:23 (NIV) - "Pride brings a person low, but the lowly in spirit gain honor." This verse implies that humility leads to honor and respect.

3. James 4:6 (NIV) - "But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: 'God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.'" This passage emphasizes that God resists the proud, but shows favor to the humble.

4. Luke 18:14 (NIV) - "I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted." This verse from Jesus' teachings in the New Testament suggests that those who are proud will be humbled, while the humble will be exalted.

These verses suggest that the Bible places a great deal of importance on humility and warns against pride. It is important to note, however, that interpretations can vary widely among different religious communities and individuals.
