  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the items contained within the Ark of the Covenant based on Biblical accounts. The student accurately lists the Three items: the Two Tablets of Stone, the pot of manna, and Aaron's budding rod. The response also acknowledges the significance of the Ark in ancient Israelite religious history and highlights the lack of physical evidence outside of the Bible. Well done!"
