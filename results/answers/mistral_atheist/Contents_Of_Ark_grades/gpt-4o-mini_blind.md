## [Answer](../Contents_Of_Ark.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 According to the Biblical account found in Exodus 25 and Leviticus 16, the Ark of the Covenant was a chest made of acacia wood covered inside and out with gold. It had a gold crown molding all around it. The Ark contained three items:

1. Two Tablets of Stone: These were inscribed with the Ten Commandments that Moses received from God on Mount Sinai.

2. A golden pot or jar called the "pot of manna": This held a sample of manna, the miraculous bread that God provided for the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.

3. Aaron's Budding Rod: This was one of the twelve rods collected from each of the tribes of Israel to confirm Aaron as the high priest. The rod of Aaron was miraculously budded and produced almonds, demonstrating that he had God's favor.

It is important to note that the Ark of the Covenant plays a significant role in the religious history of ancient Israel and has been a source of fascination for many due to its association with divine presence and power. However, it should be acknowledged that there is no physical evidence or archaeological confirmation of its existence beyond the Biblical accounts.
