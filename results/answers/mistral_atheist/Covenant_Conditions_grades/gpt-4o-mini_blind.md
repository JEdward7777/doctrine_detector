## Question [Covenant Conditions](../../../questions/Covenant_Conditions.md)
What are some examples of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible?

An example of an unconditional covenant is God's promise to never destroy the earth again with a flood. In contrast, conditional covenants require obedience from the people, such as the covenant at Sinai where God said, 'If you will obey my voice and keep my covenant...'

## Stated Concern
Understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants.

## [Answer](../Covenant_Conditions.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, both conditional and unconditional covenants play significant roles in shaping the relationship between God and humanity. Let's explore a few examples of each:

1. Conditional Covenant - Noachian Covenant (Genesis 9:8-17)
   The Noachian Covenant, also known as the Rainbow Covenant, is one of the most well-known conditional covenants in the Bible. In this covenant, God establishes a contract with Noah and his descendants that He will never again destroy the earth by flood, so long as humanity respects certain conditions such as not shedding blood any more than necessary (Genesis 9:6).

2. Conditional Covenant - Mosaic Covenant (Exodus 19:5-8)
   The Mosaic Covenant is the agreement God made with Israel through Moses at Mount Sinai. In this covenant, God promises to make Israel a holy nation and a kingdom of priests if they will follow His laws and teachings (Exodus 19:5-6). This covenant also includes the Ten Commandments as conditions for the continued blessings promised by God.

3. Unconditional Covenant - Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 12:1-3; 15:18)
   The Abrahamic Covenant is one of the most important covenants in the Bible, as it sets the stage for the promise of a future nation (the Israelites) and blessing to all families on earth through Abraham's descendant Jesus (Genesis 12:3). God promises to give Abraham and his descendants the land of Canaan and make them into a great nation, even though Abraham was not perfect and sometimes failed to follow God's commands. This covenant is considered unconditional because God's promises are not contingent on Abraham or his descendants keeping specific conditions.

4. Unconditional Covenant - New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Hebrews 8:6-13)
   The New Covenant, established through Jesus Christ, is another example of an unconditional covenant. This covenant promises that God will forgive sins and write His laws on the hearts of the people (Jeremiah 31:33). Unlike the Mosaic Covenant, the New Covenant does not depend on the ability of human beings to keep certain conditions but rather on God's grace and mercy.

In both conditional and unconditional covenants, understanding the cultural context and historical background is crucial for a nuanced interpretation. These covenants have shaped the religious, social, and political landscape of Western civilization throughout history.
