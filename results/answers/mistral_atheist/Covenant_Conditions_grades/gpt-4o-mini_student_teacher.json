  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of both conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible, giving specific examples and demonstrating an understanding of the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants. They accurately identified the conditions and lack of conditions in the covenants discussed. The only room for improvement would be to directly link back to the given concern in each example provided."
