  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible. They provide clear examples of both types of covenants and explain the cultural context and historical background of each. The inclusion of the New Covenant as an unconditional covenant is particularly insightful. However, the student could improve their grade by providing more detail and analysis of the conditions and blessings associated with each covenant."
