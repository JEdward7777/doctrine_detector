However, the perspective expressed at the end as an atheistic scholar disregards the Christian worldview of God's role in establishing and maintaining the covenant with His chosen people. A Christian-specific worldview emphasizes the significance of God's promises and the divine relationship with the Israelites, which is not fully acknowledged in the response."
