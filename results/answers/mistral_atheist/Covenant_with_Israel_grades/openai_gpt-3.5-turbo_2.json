The response acknowledges the covenant and the Israelites as God's chosen people but lacks depth in highlighting the significance of this relationship in the context of God's promises and faithfulness throughout Biblical history. More emphasis on the theological implications of God's covenant with His people would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
