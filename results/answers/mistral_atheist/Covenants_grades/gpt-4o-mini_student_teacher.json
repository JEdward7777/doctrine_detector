  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the student provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of biblical covenants from a historical and cultural perspective, they missed the opportunity to fully emphasize the continuity of God's promises throughout Scripture. The student's response could have been strengthened by highlighting how the promises in biblical covenants consistently demonstrate God's faithfulness and overarching plan of redemption for His people. Encouraging more connection to the concern would have improved the grade."
