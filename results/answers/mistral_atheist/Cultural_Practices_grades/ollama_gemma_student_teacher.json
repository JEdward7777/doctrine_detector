  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and informative response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and their impact on early Christian practices. The student provides a comprehensive overview of the relevant cultural norms and their influence on early Christianity, including the concepts of holiness and separation, messianic expectations, the chosen people, and the debate between law and grace. The response also acknowledges the eventual evolution of Christianity into its own distinct religion."
