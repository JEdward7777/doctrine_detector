  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of exploring how ancient Jewish cultural norms influenced the early Christian movement, covering topics such as holiness and separation, messianic expectations, God's chosen people, and law and grace. It also acknowledges that Christianity eventually evolved into its own distinct religion, shaped by various cultures and contexts.\n\nHowever, to fully address the concern about cultural norms influencing faith communities and their practices, I think the response could have delved deeper into the specific ways in which Jewish customs and laws impacted early Christian interactions with Gentiles. While it's mentioned that these norms initially created barriers in the early church, a more detailed analysis of how these challenges were overcome or reinterpreted would have strengthened the response.\n\nAdditionally, some connections to the provided answer (\"Jews traditionally avoided eating with or associating with Gentiles...\") could have been made to further illustrate the significance of cultural norms in shaping faith communities. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the complex interplay between Jewish culture and early Christianity, making it a solid grade of 85."
