  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of how cultural norms, specifically regarding interactions between Jews and Gentiles, influenced the early Christian movement. It effectively connects this historical context to the development of Christian beliefs and practices, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective. The only minor deduction is for not explicitly referencing the significance of the Messianic expectations in shaping early Christian inclusivity and acceptance of Gentiles, as mentioned in the provided answer. Overall, a thorough and well-supported response."
