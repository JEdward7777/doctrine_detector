## [Answer](../Cultural_Practices.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In ancient Judaism, Gentiles (non-Jews) were often viewed through a lens shaped by religious laws and cultural norms as described in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). The relationship between Jews and Gentiles was complex, with some levels of interaction and cooperation allowed, but significant boundaries established to maintain Jewish identity and purity. These cultural practices had a profound influence on the early Christian movement, shaping its self-understanding, interactions with non-Christians, and religious practices.

1. **Holiness and Separation**: Jews were commanded to be set apart from the Gentile world in order to maintain their unique identity and relationship with God. This was often expressed through dietary laws (e.g., kosher food), prohibitions on intermarriage, and avoidance of certain practices associated with foreign religions. Early Christians, who initially consisted mostly of Jews, adopted some of these practices but also developed new ones that emphasized their allegiance to Jesus Christ.

2. **Messianic Expectations**: The Jewish expectation for a Messiah played a significant role in the emergence of Christianity. Jews believed that God would send a savior who would deliver them from Roman rule, reestablish Israel as a great nation, and usher in an era of peace and prosperity. When Jesus was understood by his followers as this long-awaited Messiah, it gave Christianity a distinctive identity rooted in Judaism but with unique twists.

3. **God's Chosen People**: Jews believed that they were God's chosen people, entrusted with the divine revelation and destined to be a light unto the nations. Early Christians affirmed this concept but expanded it by claiming that Jesus Christ was the fulfillment of these promises and that through faith in him, Gentiles could become part of God's chosen people. This opened the door for Christianity to spread beyond Israel and eventually become a global religion.

4. **Law and Grace**: The Jewish law played an essential role in shaping Jewish identity and practice, but early Christians debated its significance for the new faith. Some groups like the Pharisees and Sadducees had differing interpretations of the law's application, which carried over into Christian debates between Paul and the Jerusalem apostles (Acts 15). The eventual decision at the Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15) allowed Gentile converts to avoid some of the Jewish laws but still uphold key ethical standards.

These cultural practices had a significant impact on early Christian practices by establishing foundational beliefs, shaping interactions with non-Christians, and defining essential religious practices. However, it's important to note that Christianity eventually evolved into its own distinct religion, influenced by various cultures and contexts as it spread throughout the world.
