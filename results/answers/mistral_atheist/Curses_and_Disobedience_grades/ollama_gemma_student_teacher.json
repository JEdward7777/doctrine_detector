  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the passage in Galatians 3:10. The student clearly explains the cultural context of the curse in relation to the Mosaic Covenant and avoids attributing divine punishment to an omnipotent God. The inclusion of the perspective of atheistic scholars adds nuance to the discussion and demonstrates the student's ability to consider different interpretations of the text."
