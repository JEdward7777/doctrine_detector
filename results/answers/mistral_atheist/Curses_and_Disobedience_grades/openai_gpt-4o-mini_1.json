However, the analysis could be improved by incorporating a more robust Christian worldview perspective that emphasizes the divine aspect of the curse as a consequence of disobeying God's commands rather than solely focusing on the societal or moral implications as suggested by atheistic scholars. Additionally, the explanation could benefit from a clearer connection to how this understanding of curses in Galatians 3:10 applies to Christians today in terms of the importance of obedience to God's commands."
