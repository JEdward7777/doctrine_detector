  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student gave a thorough and well-researched answer exploring various interpretations of the curse on the snake in Genesis 3:14. They touched on the symbolism and possible theological implications of the curse, considering cultural and historical contexts. However, the student's answer lacks a clear and direct connection to the broader theological implications of sin and the promise of redemption as specified in the concern. The student could have strengthened their argument by directly linking the curse on the snake to the overarching theme of sin and redemption in scripture, as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
