However, the depth of theological understanding could be improved by including the aspect of dying to self and surrendering to God's will, as taking up the cross involves crucifying one's own desires and following Jesus wholeheartedly. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of self-denial and obedience to Christ's teachings would enhance the overall theological accuracy of the response."
