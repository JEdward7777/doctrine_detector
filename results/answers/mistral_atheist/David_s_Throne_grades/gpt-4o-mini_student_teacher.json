  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful explanation of the symbolic and messianic significance of the promise of David's eternal throne in Christian theology. While their answer is comprehensive and well-reasoned, it does not explicitly state that the promise signifies Jesus reigning as king forever, which is the key point in understanding the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus as highlighted in the concern. Therefore, the student's answer, although insightful, falls slightly short of directly addressing the specified concern in the reference answer."
