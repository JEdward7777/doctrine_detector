The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the symbolic and messianic aspects of the promise, showing how it represents God's covenant with His people and the continuity of His plan through Jesus. The connection drawn between David's lineage and Jesus as the eternal King is well-supported and aligns with Christian beliefs. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern raised regarding the importance of understanding this promise in relation to God's plan fulfilled in Jesus. Well done!"
