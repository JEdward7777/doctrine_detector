  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'Day of the Lord' in the New Testament, highlighting its significance and various interpretations. However, the student's answer lacks a clear emphasis on the return of the Lord Jesus for judgment, which is the central focus of the 'day of the Lord' in Christian theology. There is good insight into the concept, but the answer could be improved by focusing more on the specific Christian understanding of the 'day of the Lord' as stated in the reference answer."
