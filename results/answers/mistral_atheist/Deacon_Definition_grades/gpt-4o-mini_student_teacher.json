  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 50/100. While the student provided a comprehensive list of duties associated with the role of a deacon in various Christian denominations, they did not emphasize the primary biblical role of servanthood. The biblical role of a deacon is centered around serving others, specifically in practical needs such as food or money, as stated in the teacher's reference answer. The student's answer focused more on the general tasks and responsibilities of deacons rather than highlighting the biblical foundation of servanthood in the role. Moving forward, the student should ensure their response aligns with the biblical understanding of servanthood in the context of a deacon's role."
