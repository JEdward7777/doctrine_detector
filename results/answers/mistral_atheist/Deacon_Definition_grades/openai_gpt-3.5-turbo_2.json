  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies the practical aspect of a deacon's role in serving fellow believers with needs such as food or money, which aligns with the biblical principle of servanthood in the church. However, the response lacks depth in highlighting the broader functions and responsibilities associated with the office of a deacon within a Christian worldview, which encompass not only practical assistance but also spiritual guidance, representation, modeling Christ-like behavior, and administrative support. Overall, a good understanding of servanthood in a limited scope within the church context is demonstrated."
