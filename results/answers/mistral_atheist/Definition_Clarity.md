## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Christian context, as defined by the Bible (Old and New Testaments), adultery refers to sexual acts outside of marriage between two individuals who are not each other's spouses. This concept is rooted in the Ten Commandments, specifically the seventh commandment: "You shall not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14).

In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word for adultery is 'năqabah' which means to 'deceive' or 'have sexual relations with someone who is not one's spouse'. The New Testament uses the Greek term 'moikēria', meaning 'unlawful sexual intercourse between a man and another man’s wife'.

It's important to note that the Bible extends the concept of adultery metaphorically, as well. Jesus Christ famously stated in Matthew 15:19 that "out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality..." Here, 'adultery' is used symbolically to represent spiritual unfaithfulness and turning away from God.

However, interpretations can vary among different Christian denominations and scholars. This answer aims to provide a general understanding based on the most commonly accepted scriptural definitions.
