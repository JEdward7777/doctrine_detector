## Question [Definition Clarity](../../../questions/Definition_Clarity.md)
How is the term 'adultery' defined in the Christian context according to Scripture?

## Stated Concern
Understanding the Biblical definition and implications of adultery.

## [Answer](../Definition_Clarity.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Christian context, as defined by the Bible (Old and New Testaments), adultery refers to sexual acts outside of marriage between two individuals who are not each other's spouses. This concept is rooted in the Ten Commandments, specifically the seventh commandment: "You shall not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14).

In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word for adultery is 'năqabah' which means to 'deceive' or 'have sexual relations with someone who is not one's spouse'. The New Testament uses the Greek term 'moikēria', meaning 'unlawful sexual intercourse between a man and another man’s wife'.

It's important to note that the Bible extends the concept of adultery metaphorically, as well. Jesus Christ famously stated in Matthew 15:19 that "out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality..." Here, 'adultery' is used symbolically to represent spiritual unfaithfulness and turning away from God.

However, interpretations can vary among different Christian denominations and scholars. This answer aims to provide a general understanding based on the most commonly accepted scriptural definitions.

Comment: This response provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of how the term 'adultery' is defined in the Christian context according to Scripture. It accurately explains the biblical roots of the concept, both in the Old and New Testaments, and also touches on the metaphorical use of 'adultery' as a symbol of spiritual unfaithfulness. The inclusion of the original Hebrew and Greek terms adds depth to the explanation. The response effectively communicates the general understanding of adultery within Christianity, though a slight improvement could be made by elaborating on the consequences or teachings related to adultery in Christian doctrine.
