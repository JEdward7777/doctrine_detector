  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that includes explanations of the Biblical definitions of adultery from both the Old and New Testaments, and they also touched upon the metaphorical use of adultery in Scripture. However, the student's answer could have been improved by focusing more on the explicit condemnation of adultery as a sin in the Bible, as highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, the student effectively acknowledged differing interpretations among denominations and scholars, which shows an awareness of varying perspectives within Christianity."
