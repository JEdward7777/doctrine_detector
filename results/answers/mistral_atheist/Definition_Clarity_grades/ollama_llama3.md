## Question [Definition Clarity](../../../questions/Definition_Clarity.md)
How is the term 'adultery' defined in the Christian context according to Scripture?

## Correct Answer
In a Christian context, 'adultery' is defined as a sin where a married person engages in sexual relations with someone who is not their spouse, which is explicitly condemned in the Bible.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the Biblical definition and implications of adultery.

## [Answer](../Definition_Clarity.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Christian context, as defined by the Bible (Old and New Testaments), adultery refers to sexual acts outside of marriage between two individuals who are not each other's spouses. This concept is rooted in the Ten Commandments, specifically the seventh commandment: "You shall not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14).

In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word for adultery is 'năqabah' which means to 'deceive' or 'have sexual relations with someone who is not one's spouse'. The New Testament uses the Greek term 'moikēria', meaning 'unlawful sexual intercourse between a man and another man’s wife'.

It's important to note that the Bible extends the concept of adultery metaphorically, as well. Jesus Christ famously stated in Matthew 15:19 that "out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality..." Here, 'adultery' is used symbolically to represent spiritual unfaithfulness and turning away from God.

However, interpretations can vary among different Christian denominations and scholars. This answer aims to provide a general understanding based on the most commonly accepted scriptural definitions.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a clear understanding of the biblical definition and implications of adultery in the Christian context, citing relevant scripture (Exodus 20:14) and explaining the metaphoric extension of the concept in Jesus' teachings (Matthew 15:19). The response also acknowledges the importance of considering the broader biblical context and its varying interpretations among different denominations and scholars.

The main areas for improvement are:

1. Lack of detailed explanations on the Hebrew and Greek words used in the Old Testament, which could provide further insight into the scriptural understanding of adultery.
2. Minimal discussion on the New Testament's teaching on adultery beyond mentioning Jesus' statement in Matthew 15:19.
3. Limited consideration of the implications of adultery beyond its definition, such as its consequences for individuals and communities.

Overall, while the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical concept of adultery, it could be improved by exploring these additional aspects in greater depth.
