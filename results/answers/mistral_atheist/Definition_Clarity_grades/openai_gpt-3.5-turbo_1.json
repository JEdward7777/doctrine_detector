  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the Biblical definition of adultery by referencing both the Old and New Testaments, the original Hebrew and Greek terms, as well as the metaphorical implications of adultery. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The deduction of 5 points is due to a minor lack of clarity in connecting the metaphorical aspect of adultery to the core definition presented in the answer."
