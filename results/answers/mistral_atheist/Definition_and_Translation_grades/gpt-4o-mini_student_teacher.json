  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer, showcasing a deep understanding of the term 'intercede' and its implications in different biblical contexts. They offered a wide range of alternative translations that capture the essence of intercession while demonstrating cultural sensitivity and awareness of emotional dynamics. The additional examples from biblical narratives further enriched their response. The only critique is that the student could have included a more direct connection to the specific translations provided in the reference answer."
