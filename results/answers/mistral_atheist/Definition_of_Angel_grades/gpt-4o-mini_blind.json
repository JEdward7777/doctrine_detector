The student correctly identifies the Greek origin of the term \"angel\" and references relevant biblical passages. However, the response could be enhanced by emphasizing the doctrinal significance of angels in Christian theology, such as their role in spiritual warfare (Ephesians 6:12) and worship of God (Revelation 5:11-12). Including these aspects would provide a more comprehensive understanding of angels from a Christian worldview."
