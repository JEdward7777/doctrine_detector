## [Answer](../Definition_of_Angel.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar, I approach religious texts with a focus on understanding their historical, cultural, and literary contexts. In Christianity, angels are spiritual beings mentioned frequently in both the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament. The term "angel" comes from the Greek word "angelos," which means "messenger."

Biblically, angels are often depicted as messengers or servants of God, who carry out his will and communicate important messages to humans. They are described as being pure spirits without bodily form (Hebrews 1:14), but they can take on human-like appearances when necessary (Genesis 18:2; Exodus 3:2).

The primary role of angels in the Bible is to serve as God's messengers, delivering messages from Him to humans. They are also involved in protecting and guiding God's people (Daniel 6:22), and they play a significant role in important events throughout both testaments, such as the annunciation of Jesus' birth (Luke 1:26-38) and the ascension of Jesus to heaven (Acts 1:9-11).

It is important to note that interpretations of religious texts can vary widely among different cultural, historical, and philosophical perspectives. This brief explanation is intended as a general overview of angels in the biblical context, and I encourage further study and exploration for a more nuanced understanding.
