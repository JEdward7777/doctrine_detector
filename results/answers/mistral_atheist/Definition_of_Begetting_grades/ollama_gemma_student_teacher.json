They correctly point out its usage in describing the lineage of patriarchs and Jesus Christ. Additionally, they acknowledge the cultural context of the term and its limitations in light of modern scientific understanding. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of begetting in relation to God's creation and familial roles from a Christian perspective."
