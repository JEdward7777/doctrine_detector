However, it falls short in addressing the concern regarding the identity and significance of being a believer in Christ. It lacks depth in explaining the transformative nature of belief in Christ and how it impacts one's identity and life. A stronger connection to the Christian worldview regarding the significance of faith in Christ would have improved the response significantly."
