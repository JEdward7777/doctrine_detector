The references to Jesus addressing his disciples as \"the beloved\" and God declaring certain prophets and kings as His \"beloved\" add depth to the explanation. The answer could be strengthened by incorporating more references from Scripture to support the points made and by delving deeper into the theological implications of being called \"beloved.\""
