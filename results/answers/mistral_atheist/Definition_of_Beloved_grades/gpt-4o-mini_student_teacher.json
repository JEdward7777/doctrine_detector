  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-explained answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the term \"beloved\" in a biblical context. They correctly highlight the special relationship and deep affection signified by the term in various Biblical passages. However, the answer could be improved by directly addressing the concern raised about the depth of God's love for Jesus and its relation to believers. The student's response touches on the concept but could benefit from a more explicit connection to this specific aspect of the question."
