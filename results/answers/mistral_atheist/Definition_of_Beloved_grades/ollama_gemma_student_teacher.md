It is used to express love, favor, and preference. For example, in the New Testament, Jesus refers to his disciples as "the beloved" (Agapetoi in Greek). Similarly, in the Old Testament, God declares certain prophets and kings as His "beloved" (e.g., Hosea 11:4, Jeremiah 31:3). It is also used to describe relationships between friends and family members, emphasizing a bond that goes beyond mere acquaintance or casual association.
