  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid understanding of the term \"church\" in the New Testament, emphasizing the community of believers in Jesus Christ rather than a physical building. The student correctly mentioned the interconnectedness of believers and the concept of local churches in various cities or regions. The biblical references and explanation were clear and accurate. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of the church's role in serving and spreading the Gospel beyond just meeting together as believers."
