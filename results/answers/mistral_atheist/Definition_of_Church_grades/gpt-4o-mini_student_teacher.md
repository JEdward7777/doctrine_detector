## [Answer](../Definition_of_Church.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the New Testament, the term "church" (ecclesia in Greek) refers to a community of believers in Jesus Christ. It is not necessarily a physical building but a group of people united by their faith in Christ and the teachings of the Bible. The church is often described as the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:27), emphasizing the unity and interconnectedness of its members. The New Testament also speaks of local churches, which were specific communities of believers in various cities or regions. These local churches were intended to be self-governing, but connected through shared beliefs and practices as part of a larger body of Christ.
