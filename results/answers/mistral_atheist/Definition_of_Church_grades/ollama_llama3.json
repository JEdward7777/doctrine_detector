While it acknowledges that the church is not just a physical building, it oversimplifies the concept by reducing it to simply being \"a local assembly of believers meeting together.\" The original response provides a more nuanced understanding by highlighting the church's unity and interconnectedness with Christ, as well as its self-governing nature. To further improve this response, it could be enriched by exploring the implications of the church being the body of Christ and the role of local churches within the larger global community of believers."
