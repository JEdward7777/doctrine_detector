  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good overview of confession in the Christian tradition, mentioning both the acknowledgment of sins and the profession of faith in Jesus Christ. They correctly referenced relevant Bible verses to support their points. However, the student's response lacked depth in exploring the biblical context of confession beyond surface-level interpretations. Encouraging further analysis and connection to the core teachings of Christianity would have strengthened their answer from a Christian worldview perspective. Additionally, the mention of personal atheistic beliefs at the end detracted from a comprehensive understanding of confession within Christian faith."
