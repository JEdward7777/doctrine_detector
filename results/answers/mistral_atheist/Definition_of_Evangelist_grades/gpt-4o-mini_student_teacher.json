  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the term \"evangelist.\" However, the main concern was understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel, which the student did not directly address. The response focused more on the origin and traditional use of the term in Christian theology rather than how evangelists fulfill their role in sharing the good news of Jesus Christ. There was comprehensive knowledge demonstrated, but not fully relevant to the concern raised."
