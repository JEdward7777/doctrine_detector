  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer a 75. While the student provides a general overview of the Biblical concepts of 'good' and 'evil', they maintain a neutral stance and rely on scholarly interpretations rather than presenting a firm Christian perspective. The response lacks a clear assertion of the absolute nature of good and evil as defined by God in the Bible. Going forward, the student should aim to incorporate more explicit references to key Biblical passages and theological principles to strengthen their analysis."
