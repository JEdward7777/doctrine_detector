  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides a generally accurate explanation of the Biblical understanding of 'good' and 'evil', the response lacks the crucial point that 'good' is defined as morally right. Additionally, the student does not explicitly address the concern of understanding the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making. The student accurately references Biblical verses to support their explanation, which is commendable, but could have further elaborated on the application of these concepts in practical decision-making scenarios to better address the concern provided.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil', but could have been improved by incorporating a more direct link to how these concepts impact daily decision-making from a Christian worldview perspective."
