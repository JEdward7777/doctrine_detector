  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil' and effectively contrasts the two concepts. The response provides clear examples from scripture and acknowledges the complexity of the concepts, considering cultural and historical contexts. However, it would benefit from further elaboration on the moral implications of these concepts in daily decision-making, specifically referencing the student's concern."
