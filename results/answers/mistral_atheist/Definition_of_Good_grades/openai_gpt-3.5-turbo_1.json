  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the biblical understanding of 'good' and 'evil' in relation to moral implications and contrasts them effectively. However, it lacks a direct connection to the concern of understanding the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making. To improve the grade, a more practical application or examples of how this biblical understanding can guide daily decision-making would have been beneficial."
