The explanation is well-supported with relevant Biblical references. However, the response could have been stronger if it had directly addressed the concern about understanding the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making, by providing clearer guidance or practical application of these concepts in everyday life from a Christian perspective."
