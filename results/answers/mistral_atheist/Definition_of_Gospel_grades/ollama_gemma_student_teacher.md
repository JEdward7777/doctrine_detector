## [Answer](../Definition_of_Gospel.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The term "Gospel" comes from the Anglo-Saxon word "God-spell," which is derived from Old English and translates to "good news from God." In a broader sense, it can be used to describe any message or account that delivers good news.

In the context of Christianity, the Gospels are the first four books of the New Testament in the Bible: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Each of these books tells the story of Jesus Christ's life, teachings, death, and resurrection from a unique perspective. The Gospel accounts provide an understanding of who Jesus was, what he taught, and how his message and actions changed the lives of those around him and have impacted people for centuries since.

The term "Gospel" within Christianity signifies the good news of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ and His teachings. This idea is central to Christian belief and forms the foundation of the Christian faith.
