  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful explanation of the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible, highlighting its religious and moral connotations. However, the student's answer did not specifically focus on the unique role of God in scripture as the teacher's reference answer did. It would have been stronger if the student had centered more explicitly on God's holiness and unique divine nature as the 'Holy One.' Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept and its significance within biblical and broader cultural contexts."
