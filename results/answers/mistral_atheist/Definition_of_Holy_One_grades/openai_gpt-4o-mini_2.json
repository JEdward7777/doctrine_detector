  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response 90/100. The student has provided a thorough explanation of the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible, emphasizing its significance in highlighting the holiness of God, particularly in connection to the Old Testament concept of the \"Holy One of Israel\" and Jesus in the New Testament. The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the holiness of God and His unique role in scripture from a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a more explicit connection to the Christian view of Jesus as the embodiment of divine holiness in the New Testament."
