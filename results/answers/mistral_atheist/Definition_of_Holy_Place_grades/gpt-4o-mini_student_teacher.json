  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer that demonstrates a solid understanding of the religious, cultural, and symbolic significance of the holy place in the context of the Tabernacle/Temple. The answer effectively addresses the concern of understanding the design and function of God's dwelling place. However, the reference answer from the teacher focuses on a more concise and specific aspect of the holy place, which the student's answer could have mirrored more closely to receive a higher grade."
