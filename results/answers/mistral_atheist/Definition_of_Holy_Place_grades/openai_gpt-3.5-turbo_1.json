It effectively addresses the concern of understanding God's dwelling place by highlighting the special nature of the holy place as a space set apart for God's presence. The response could be further enhanced by connecting these aspects to the overarching theme of God's presence and the significance of His dwelling among His people in the context of Christian theology."
