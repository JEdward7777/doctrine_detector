 In the context of the Bible, repentance refers to a change of heart and mind that results in turning away from sinful behavior and turning towards God. It involves acknowledging one's wrongdoings, expressing genuine remorse or sorrow for them, and making a conscious effort to live a life that aligns with God's commands and teachings.

Repentance is often associated with a sense of regret for past actions and a determination to do better in the future. It can be initiated by an individual upon recognizing their own shortcomings or sins, but it may also come as a response to divine intervention, such as through preaching or witnessing miracles.

Repentance is emphasized throughout the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament prophetic books and in the teachings of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. It is considered an essential step towards salvation and spiritual growth for followers of Christianity.

In summary, to repent according to the Bible means to acknowledge one's sinful behavior, express remorse or sorrow for it, and make a commitment to turn away from those actions and live a life in accordance with God's will.
