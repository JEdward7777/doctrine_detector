  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of repentance according to the Bible, covering key aspects such as acknowledging sins, expressing genuine remorse, and committing to living in alignment with God's will. The student also correctly highlighted the importance of repentance for spiritual growth and salvation.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more on the actual act of turning away from sin and returning to God, as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher. While the student touched on this concept, the reference answer succinctly captures the core essence of repentance more directly.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of repentance from a biblical perspective, with minor room for improvement in aligning more closely with the reference answer."
