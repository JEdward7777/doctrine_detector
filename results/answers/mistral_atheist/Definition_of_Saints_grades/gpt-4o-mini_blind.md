## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of the New Testament, the term "saints" refers to believers in Jesus Christ. The Greek word used is "hagios," which means holy or set apart for God. It was not an individual title but rather a collective term indicating all the faithful members of the early Christian community. These saints were considered as being sanctified or made holy by their faith in Jesus and obedience to his teachings. The concept of "sainthood" in the modern sense, where individuals are recognized as having extraordinary holiness, did not fully develop until much later in Christian history.
