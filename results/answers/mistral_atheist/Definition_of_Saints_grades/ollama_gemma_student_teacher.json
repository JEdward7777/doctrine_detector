  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the Biblical definition of \"saints\" as believers in Jesus Christ. They accurately explain the Greek origin of the word \"hagios\" and its meaning of \"holy\" or \"set apart for God.\" The student also correctly notes that the concept of sainthood in the modern sense developed later in Christian history. However, the answer could benefit from additional elaboration on the significance of saints within the New Testament context, particularly their relationship to the early Christian community."
