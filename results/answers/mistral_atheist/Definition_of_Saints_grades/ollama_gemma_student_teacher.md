## Question [Definition of Saints](../../../questions/Definition_of_Saints.md)
What does the term 'saints' mean in the context of the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
The term 'saints' literally means 'holy ones' and refers to believers in Jesus.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the correct Biblical definition of saints helps to distinguish between cultural and scriptural interpretations.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of the New Testament, the term "saints" refers to believers in Jesus Christ. The Greek word used is "hagios," which means holy or set apart for God. It was not an individual title but rather a collective term indicating all the faithful members of the early Christian community. These saints were considered as being sanctified or made holy by their faith in Jesus and obedience to his teachings. The concept of "sainthood" in the modern sense, where individuals are recognized as having extraordinary holiness, did not fully develop until much later in Christian history.

**Grade:** 85/100

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the Biblical definition of "saints" as believers in Jesus Christ. They accurately explain the Greek origin of the word "hagios" and its meaning of "holy" or "set apart for God." The student also correctly notes that the concept of sainthood in the modern sense developed later in Christian history. However, the answer could benefit from additional elaboration on the significance of saints within the New Testament context, particularly their relationship to the early Christian community.
