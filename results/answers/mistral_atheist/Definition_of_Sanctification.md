## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian Biblical context, "sanctify" and "be sanctified" relate to the process of being set apart for the service of God, or becoming holy. The word "sanctify" (or "hagios" in Greek) is used frequently throughout the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, to describe the act of making something or someone holy or sacred through a religious rite or ritual, often by dedicating them to God's service.

Regarding individuals, sanctification refers to the moral and spiritual transformation of believers as they grow in their relationship with God. It is an ongoing process that occurs throughout one's life as they seek to live according to God's will and become more like Jesus Christ (Romans 8:29). Sanctification involves the renewal of one's mind, heart, and actions through the work of the Holy Spirit within them.

In summary, sanctifying or being sanctified in the Bible means to be set apart for God, consecrated to His service, and becoming more holy as a result of following Him and growing in faith.
