The reference to Proverbs and the emphasis on the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom are well-supported by Scripture. The student effectively conveys that biblical wisdom involves more than just knowledge, highlighting the importance of aligning one's actions with God's will. The answer could be further enhanced by including references to other key biblical passages on wisdom, but overall, it demonstrates a strong grasp of the concept. Great job!"
