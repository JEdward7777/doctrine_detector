## [Answer](../Definition_of_Wisdom.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Biblical context, wisdom is often portrayed as a divine attribute and a virtue that humans can aspire to possess. It encompasses more than mere book-learning or intellectual acumen; it involves understanding, discernment, and the ability to apply knowledge in practical ways that lead to a fulfilling life aligned with God's will.

In Proverbs 9:13, wisdom is described as "a woman, she is stern, and is grindingly clever" (NIV). The idea here is that wisdom can be both strict (requiring discipline) and shrewd (possessing insight and foresight).

Additionally, Biblical wisdom often emphasizes the importance of understanding and practicing righteousness, justice, kindness, and compassion. Proverbs 1:7 says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction." This passage indicates that wisdom begins with reverence for God, respecting His laws and teachings, and valuing the guidance that comes from Him.

Lastly, Biblical wisdom is often portrayed as a way to avoid temptation, navigate difficult situations, and make sound decisions in life. In other words, it is the ability to discern between right and wrong, and to choose the path that leads to a flourishing life.

Overall, being wise according to the biblical definition involves cultivating knowledge, understanding God's will, and practicing virtues like justice, kindness, and compassion while making sound decisions and avoiding temptation.
