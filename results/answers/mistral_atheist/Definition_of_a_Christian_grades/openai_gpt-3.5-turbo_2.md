## [Answer](../Definition_of_a_Christian.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian theology, a "Christian" is an individual who believes in and follows Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the savior of humanity through his atoning death and resurrection. This belief system is based primarily on the teachings of the New Testament in the Bible. Christians are expected to live according to the teachings of Jesus and His example, demonstrating love for God and love for others (Matthew 22:37-40). Additionally, they acknowledge the authority of Jesus' life, teachings, death, and resurrection as recorded in the New Testament.

However, it's important to note that there are many different denominations within Christianity, each with their own unique beliefs, practices, and interpretations of the Bible. Therefore, while the basic definition may hold true across various Christian traditions, the specifics can vary significantly.
