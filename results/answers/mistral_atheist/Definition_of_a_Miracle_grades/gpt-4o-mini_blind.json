  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student provided a well-written explanation of miracles from both a religious and atheistic perspective. However, the answer does not fully align with a Christian worldview, as it primarily focuses on naturalistic explanations and skepticism towards miracles. From a Christian perspective, miracles are seen as interventions by God that go beyond natural laws, demonstrating His authority and power. The answer could be improved by giving more weight to the significance of miracles as divine acts of God rather than mere natural phenomena or fraud."
