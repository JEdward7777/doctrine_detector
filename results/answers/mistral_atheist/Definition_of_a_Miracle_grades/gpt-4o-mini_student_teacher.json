  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed explanation of miracles from a religious and atheistic perspective, demonstrating an understanding of different viewpoints. However, the student fails to align fully with the Christian worldview in acknowledging miracles as solely attributed to God's intervention and authority. The response lacks emphasis on the divine aspect of miracles and the significance of these events in affirming God's power. Overall, the student's answer could benefit from a stronger connection to the Christian perspective on miracles and God's authority."
