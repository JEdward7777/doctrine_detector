The atheistic perspective presented undermines the concept of miracles by attributing them to natural phenomena, misperceptions, or fraud, without fully recognizing the possibility of divine intervention. This undermines the deeper faith and acknowledgment of God's power, which is essential in understanding miracles from a Christian worldview."
