## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Old Testament, the term "people of God" (Hebrew: עַם הָאֱלֹהִים, 'ām hāʾēlōhīm; Greek: λαός τοῦ θεοῦ, laos tou theou) refers to those who are chosen by God and form a special relationship with Him. This term is used in both inclusive and exclusive ways to describe not only the Israelites but also other nations or individuals recognized as being in a covenantal relationship with Yahweh (God of Israel).

The people of God are chosen because they adhere to God's laws, follow His guidance, and demonstrate faithfulness. The relationship is based on God's promise to care for them, protect them, and bless them, while the people's duty is to obey Him, worship Him, and serve Him.

The concept of being "the people of God" is central to the Old Testament and sets the foundation for the beliefs and values of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. However, interpretations may vary based on cultural and religious contexts.
