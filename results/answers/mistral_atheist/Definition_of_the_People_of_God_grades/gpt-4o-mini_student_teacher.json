  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written explanation of the concept of the \"people of God\" in the Old Testament, touching on the inclusive and exclusive ways the term is used and the responsibilities of those chosen by God. However, the student's answer deviates from the teacher's reference answer by including references to other nations or individuals being considered part of the people of God. The specific concern of understanding the covenant relationship God established with Israel was not fully addressed, leading to a lower grade. A stronger focus on the unique relationship between God and the nation of Israel would have improved the answer."
