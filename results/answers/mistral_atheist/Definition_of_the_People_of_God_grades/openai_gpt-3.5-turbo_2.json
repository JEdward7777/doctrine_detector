It addresses the concern of understanding the covenant relationship God established with Israel. However, the response could have further emphasized the specific terms and conditions of the covenant, such as the giving of the Law to Israel, their role as a holy nation, and the blessings and consequences tied to their obedience or disobedience. Additionally, incorporating more scriptural references or examples from the Old Testament could have strengthened the explanation from a Christian worldview."
