However, it falls short in addressing the concern regarding the importance of understanding spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ. The response focuses more on cultural and historical interpretations, neglecting the significance of the spiritual dimension in dealing with demon possession. It could be improved by emphasizing the authority of Jesus Christ in delivering individuals from demonic influences and highlighting the biblical teachings on spiritual warfare."
