The response focuses more on the historical and cultural context of demon possession and leans towards a symbolic interpretation rather than emphasizing the importance of Jesus Christ in spiritual deliverance. A stronger emphasis on the biblical worldview of spiritual warfare and the power of Jesus Christ in overcoming demonic influence would have been more aligned with the concern provided."
