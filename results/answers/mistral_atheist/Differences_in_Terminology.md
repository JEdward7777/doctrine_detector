## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholarly figure, I appreciate your question for its nuanced nature, acknowledging that these words, while sharing some similarities, have distinct connotations depending on their usage.

1. Exhort (verb): To urge earnestly or insistently; to strongly encourage someone to do something, especially as a matter of duty or necessity. It typically implies a sense of urgency and importance in the request. For instance, one might exhort a soldier to be brave in battle.

2. Encourage (verb): To inspire with confidence; to give support, heartening words or ideas that serve to bolster someone's morale or determination. It implies offering comfort, hope, or reassurance to someone facing challenges or difficulties. For example, a teacher might encourage a struggling student by pointing out their progress and potential for growth.

3. Admonish (verb): To advise earnestly, often with a warning; to caution or reprove gently, but seriously. It typically implies giving advice or guidance to prevent someone from making a mistake or repeating a negative behavior. For instance, a parent might admonish their child for misbehaving in order to teach them proper conduct.

While 'exhort' and 'encourage' generally have positive connotations, 'admonish' may be perceived as mildly negative or critical, although its intention is often to correct or guide someone in a constructive manner. All three words aim to motivate individuals to behave in specific ways but differ in their emphasis on urgency, support, and caution, respectively.
