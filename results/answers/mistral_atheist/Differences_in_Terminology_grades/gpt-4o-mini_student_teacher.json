  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of the distinctions between 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' in terms of urgency, support, and caution. The student's explanation aligns well with the Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of guiding others in righteousness and offering comfort and correction as needed. The only room for improvement would be to further emphasize the biblical basis and examples for each term to strengthen the connection to scripture in discussing the appropriate forms of encouragement."
