  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response provides some general definitions for each word, it does not accurately capture the nuanced differences between \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish.\" The provided answer simplifies these complex terms, which may lead to misunderstandings when applying them in practical situations. Furthermore, the concern about clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture is only partially addressed.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that 'admonish' may be perceived as mildly negative or critical, but it fails to explore how these words can be used biblically and practically in various contexts. Additionally, there is no explicit connection made between the definitions provided and biblical principles or examples of encouragement found in scripture.\n\nTo address this concern effectively, a more detailed analysis of relevant scriptures and practical applications would be necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of scriptural encouragement."
