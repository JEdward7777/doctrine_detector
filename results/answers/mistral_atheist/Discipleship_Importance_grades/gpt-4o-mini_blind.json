  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-researched and objective analysis of why the twelve apostles were chosen as Jesus' closest disciples, citing relevant biblical passages and criteria for their selection. However, the answer could be strengthened by explicitly discussing the theological significance of the apostles' role in the foundation of the Christian church and their unique relationship with Jesus as chosen instruments for His ministry. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the spiritual and doctrinal reasons behind the selection of the twelve apostles would enhance the overall theological depth of the response."
