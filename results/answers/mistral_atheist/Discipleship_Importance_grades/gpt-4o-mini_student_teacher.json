  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-researched and detailed answer that addresses the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. They have referenced relevant biblical passages and provided a thorough explanation of the criteria for the selection of the Twelve Apostles. However, the student could have tied their points more explicitly to the teacher's reference answer, which succinctly captures the essence of why the twelve apostles were chosen by Jesus."
