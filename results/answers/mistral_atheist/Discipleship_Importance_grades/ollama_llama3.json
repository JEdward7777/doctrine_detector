  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of highlighting the key factors that contributed to Jesus' selection of the Twelve Apostles, including their calling from God, witnessing the Transfiguration, playing leadership roles, and coming from diverse cultural and geographical backgrounds. It also provides specific biblical references to support these points.\n\nHowever, the response could be stronger in its connection to the concern about understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. While it mentions their role as teachers, healers, and witnesses, it doesn't delve deeper into how this selection contributed to the establishment of the early Church or the apostles' individual contributions to spreading the Christian message.\n\nThe given answer, \"The twelve apostles were chosen by Jesus to be his closest disciples for their unique call to spread his teachings and establish the foundation of the early Church,\" is a good starting point, but it's not as detailed or specific as the response provided. The concern about understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament encourages more nuanced analysis and consideration of the broader implications of this selection.\n\nOverall, while the response is well-researched and informative, it could be even stronger with a clearer connection to the concern and a deeper exploration of the apostles' roles and significance."
