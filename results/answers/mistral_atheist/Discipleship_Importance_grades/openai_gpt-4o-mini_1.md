## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar, it is essential to approach historical events, such as the selection of the Twelve Apostles by Jesus, with an objective and well-researched perspective. In the New Testament of the Christian Bible, there are several accounts that suggest criteria for their selection:

1. Calling from God: The Gospel of Matthew (4:18-22) and Mark (3:13-19) describe Jesus calling the apostles directly, stating "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." This statement implies that these individuals were chosen for a special purpose ordained by God.

2. Witnessing the Transfiguration: The Gospels of Matthew (17:1-9), Mark (9:2-8) and Luke (9:28-36) recount the transfiguration event, where Jesus was accompanied by three apostles: Peter, James, and John. Their participation in this unique experience may have solidified their role as close disciples to Jesus.

3. Leadership roles: The Gospels suggest that some of the Twelve Apostles played significant leadership roles among the early Christian community. For example, Peter is often portrayed as the primary spokesperson for the apostles (Matthew 16:18-19), and Judas Iscariot was tasked with managing the group's finances (John 12:6).

4. Cultural and geographical diversity: The Twelve Apostles were from a variety of backgrounds, including Galilee, Judea, and even Damascus (Acts 9:15), which may have been intentional to ensure the early Christian movement could appeal to a broader audience.

In a culturally-rooted context, it is worth noting that Jesus lived in a society where charismatic leadership was highly valued, and his choice of the Twelve Apostles reflects this cultural context. Their roles as teachers, healers, and witnesses to Jesus' ministry were crucial in spreading the Christian message following Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.
