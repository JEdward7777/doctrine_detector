However, it does not directly address the concern of maintaining clarity in translations to prevent misinterpretations concerning God's identity and authority, which is essential from a Christian worldview perspective. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly discussing how potential misunderstandings could impact Christian beliefs about God's unique identity and authority."
