## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 After the reign of King Solomon, the united kingdom of Israel underwent a division into two separate kingdoms: the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south. This historical event took place around 930 BCE, following a power struggle between Solomon's sons Rehoboam and Jeroboam. The split was primarily due to disagreements over taxation and religious policies.

In terms of cultural context, this event marked a significant shift in the political landscape of ancient Israel, with each kingdom developing its own distinct culture, traditions, and religious practices. It is an important period in Jewish history that continues to have profound implications for the region's future.
