  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a fairly accurate and detailed explanation of the major event that occurred in Israel's history after King Solomon's reign, which is the division of the united kingdom into the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context and the reasons for the split. However, to improve, they could have emphasized more the spiritual aspect of the division, such as the disobedience to God leading to consequences or the fulfillment of prophetic warnings regarding the kingdom's division. Adding these elements would enhance the doctrinal correctness from a Christian perspective."
