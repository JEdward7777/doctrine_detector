  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of the division of the Israelites, discussing the historical context, reasons for the split, and cultural implications. The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of this event both politically and culturally. However, the answer could have been improved by directly stating that the kingdoms were called \"Israel\" and \"Judah\" without including additional information not specifically asked for in the question. Overall, a well-informed and well-explained response."
