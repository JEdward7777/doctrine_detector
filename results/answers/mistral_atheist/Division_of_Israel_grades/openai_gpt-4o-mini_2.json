  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good historical overview of the division of the Israelites into the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah after King Solomon. It correctly identifies the key players involved and the primary reason for the split. Additionally, the response touches on the cultural implications of this division. However, to improve the grade, it could further delve into the spiritual significance of this event within the context of God's sovereignty and the consequences of disobedience, as outlined in the Bible."
