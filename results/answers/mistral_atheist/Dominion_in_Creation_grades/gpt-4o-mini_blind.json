  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of humanity's role in having dominion over the earth according to the Bible. They accurately reference key passages such as Genesis 1:26-28 and Leviticus 25:23. The emphasis on stewardship rather than domination is well-stated. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to delve deeper into the theological implications of humanity's role in light of Christ's fulfillment of the law and the redemption of all creation. Overall, a thorough and well-supported response."
