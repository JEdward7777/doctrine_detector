  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer that showcases a deep understanding of the concept of human stewardship over creation as taught in the Bible. They accurately referenced relevant biblical passages and appropriately emphasized the responsibility of humans to manage and care for the Earth in a way that reflects God's image. The answer effectively addresses the concern of understanding our God-given authority over creation and how to exercise it responsibly. The deduction from a perfect score is due to the slight expansion beyond the specific wording of the reference answer."
