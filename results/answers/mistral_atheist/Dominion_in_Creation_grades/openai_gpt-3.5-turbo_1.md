## [Answer](../Dominion_in_Creation.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The concept of human responsibility for managing and caring for the Earth is found throughout the Bible, particularly in the Book of Genesis. In Genesis 1:26-28, it is stated that God created humans in His image and gave them the mandate to "have dominion" over the Earth. This "dominion" is often interpreted as a stewardship role, where humans are responsible for managing and caring for the Earth on behalf of its Creator.

In this passage, humans are instructed to be fruitful, multiply, fill the Earth, and have dominion over every living thing, including fish in the sea, birds in the sky, and all animals on land. However, they are also told to rule over the Earth in a way that reflects God's image, which is often understood as acting with wisdom, compassion, and responsibility.

This idea of human stewardship is further reinforced in other parts of the Bible, such as in Leviticus 25:23, where it is stated that the land belongs to God, and humans are merely sojourners and strangers on the Earth, responsible for working and caring for it while they are here.

Overall, the Bible teaches that humanity has a special role in managing and caring for the Earth, but this role is one of stewardship rather than domination. Humans are called to be good stewards of God's creation, using their gifts and abilities to care for and preserve the world for future generations while also living in harmony with its resources.
