They provide relevant scriptures and explanations to support their claims. Additionally, they acknowledge the diverse interpretations of religious texts and the cultural contexts in which they were written. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern regarding recognizing Christ's authority in all aspects of life and its impact on faith."
