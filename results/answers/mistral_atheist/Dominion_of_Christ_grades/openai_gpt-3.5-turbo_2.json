As an atheist scholar, the respondent may not be able to fully grasp the significance of Christ's authority over all creation and how this impacts the faith of Christians. More emphasis on the spiritual and eternal implications of Jesus Christ's dominion, as well as the transformative power of His lordship in believers' lives, would better address the specified concern from a Christian perspective."
