  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed overview of the interpretations surrounding the concept of \"the last days\" in Christianity and cited relevant biblical references. However, the student did not clearly affirm the Christian belief that the duration of the last days is unknown, which is a key aspect of the Christian worldview. Additionally, the concluding atheistic perspective and emphasis on skepticism detract from a clear Christian perspective on the subject."
