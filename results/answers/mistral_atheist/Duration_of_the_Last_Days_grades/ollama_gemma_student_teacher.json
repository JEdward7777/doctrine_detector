  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a comprehensive and well-researched response that acknowledges the uncertainty regarding the duration of \"the last days\" according to the Bible. They effectively explain the various interpretations and theories among Christian denominations and scholarly perspectives. The inclusion of an atheistic perspective adds depth to the discussion by challenging the assumptions of some interpretations. However, the grade could be improved by explicitly stating that the Bible does not provide any definitive information regarding the precise duration of the last days."
