However, from a Christian worldview, the concern raised about how uncertainty regarding the duration of the last days can impact faith and Christian living is not directly addressed or engaged with in the response. Incorporating a perspective on how Christians should live in anticipation of Christ's return despite this uncertainty would enhance the depth of the analysis from a Christian-specific worldview."
