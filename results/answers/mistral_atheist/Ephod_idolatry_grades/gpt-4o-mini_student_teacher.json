  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and insightful analysis of the story of Gideon and the golden ephod, showcasing a good understanding of the cautionary tale it represents. However, there was a missed opportunity to explicitly tie the importance of focusing on God and avoiding material representations of faith as the teacher's reference concern emphasized. Encouraging the student to further connect their analysis to the specified concern would have strengthened their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
