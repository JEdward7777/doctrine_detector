  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of addressing the concern by highlighting the importance of not being distracted by material representations of faith, as seen in Gideon's creation of the golden ephod and the subsequent idolatry of the Israelites. The writer correctly identifies the danger of objectifying worship and losing sight of God.\n\nThe response also provides a clear and concise analysis of the biblical narrative, breaking down the themes of power, leadership, and human tendency to revert to old habits. The writer effectively applies these themes to broader lessons about exercising power with wisdom and humility, taking responsibility for one's own beliefs, and fostering an environment that values critical thought and self-awareness.\n\nThe only area where the response could improve is in explicitly connecting the lesson learned from this story (i.e., keeping objects associated with worship in proper perspective) to the broader concern of focusing on God rather than being distracted by material representations of faith. While the response touches on this idea, it could be further emphasized and applied more directly to the concern.\n\nOverall, however, the response provides a thoughtful and insightful analysis of the biblical narrative and its application to the concern, making it deserving of an 85-grade."
