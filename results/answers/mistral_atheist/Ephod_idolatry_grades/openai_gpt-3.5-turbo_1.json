  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the given answer by exploring the nuances of idolatry and misuse of sacred objects in the context of the story of Gideon and the golden ephod. It emphasizes the importance of critical thinking, self-awareness, and the responsibility of leaders and individuals in maintaining true worship of God. The Christian worldview of avoiding distractions and focusing on God is well-supported throughout the response. However, it could have explicitly referenced the centrality of God in worship and the consequences of idolatry even more directly to align more closely with the concern provided."
