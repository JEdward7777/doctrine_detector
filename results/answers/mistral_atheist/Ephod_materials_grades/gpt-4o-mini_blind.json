The inclusion of both the fabric and the decorative elements made from gold, silver, bronze, and precious stones aligns well with the details provided in Exodus 28 and Exodus 39. The explanation is thorough and accurately portrays the significance of the ephod in the context of ancient Jewish religious ceremonies."
