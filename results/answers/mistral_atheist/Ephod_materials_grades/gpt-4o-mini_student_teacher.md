## [Answer](../Ephod_materials.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The biblical account of the construction of the High Priest's ephod (ephod hakkohen) can be found in Exodus 28 and Exodus 39, if we are to adhere to a culturally retributed approach. According to these passages, the ephod was made from two main materials:

1. Fabric: The ephod was primarily constructed from a blend of wool and linen, dyed in blue, purple, and scarlet colors. These specific dyes were obtained from expensive sources, such as shellfish (for the purple dye) and a particular type of beetle (for the scarlet).

2. Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Precious Stones: The ephod also included various decorative elements made from these precious metals and gemstones. For example, it had two shoulder pieces covered in gold and adorned with a row of six semi-precious stones (one for each tribe of Israel) and two onyx stones, engraved with the names of the tribes. Additionally, the breastpiece was decorated with twelve more precious stones and four rows of gold filigree and settings.

The ephod served as an essential part of the High Priest's attire in ancient Jewish religious ceremonies and symbolized the priestly office and connection to God.
