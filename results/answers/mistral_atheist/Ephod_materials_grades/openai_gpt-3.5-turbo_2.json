  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the construction of the High Priest's ephod, mentioning the materials used and their significance in worship. The connection between the ephod's design and symbolism in worship is effectively highlighted. However, the response could be enhanced by explicitly discussing how the use of specific materials reflects the significance of the ephod in religious ceremonies and its representation of the priestly office and connection to God."
