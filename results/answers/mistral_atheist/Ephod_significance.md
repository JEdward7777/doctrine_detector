## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Old Testament, the ephod was a piece of clothing worn by various high priests and prophets, most notably Aaron and his descendants as well as the prophet Samuel. The ephod was not just an ordinary garment but had significant religious functions in ancient Israelite worship.

The significance of the high priest's ephod lies in its role as a medium for divine communication and guidance. It contained two important elements: the Urim and Thummim, described as "stones to decide between right and wrong" (Exodus 28:30). The exact nature and composition of these stones are not specified in the Bible, but they were presumably used by the high priest to obtain yes or no answers from God on various matters.

Additionally, the breastplate of decision (also part of the ephod) contained twelve gem-encrusted stones, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. The stones' arrangement on the breastplate corresponded with the placement of the tribes around the Tabernacle and later, the Temple in Jerusalem. This symbolized the unity of the nation under God's protection, as well as the high priest's role as an intermediary between the people and their deity.

The ephod also served a practical purpose as it provided a convenient way to store the Urim and Thummim while not in use. It was attached to the linen tunic and tied around the waist, making it easily accessible for the high priest when needed for divination purposes.

In summary, the high priest's ephod played a critical role in ancient Israelite religious life, symbolizing unity among the tribes, providing divine guidance, and serving as a tangible reminder of God's presence and intervention in human affairs.
