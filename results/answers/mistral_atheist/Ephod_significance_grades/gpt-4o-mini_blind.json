However, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological significance of the Urim and Thummim and their precise function in seeking God's will. Additionally, more emphasis could have been placed on the high priest's role as the mediator between God and the people, highlighting the importance of the ephod in this context. Overall, a good understanding is demonstrated, but there is room for further theological exploration."
