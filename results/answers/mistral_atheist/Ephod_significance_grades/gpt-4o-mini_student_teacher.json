  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the significance of the high priest's ephod in the context of Old Testament worship, highlighting its role as a medium for divine communication and guidance. The student accurately described the Urim and Thummim and their function in discerning God's will. However, the student could have focused more on the priestly role of mediation between God and the people, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could improve by incorporating more details on the priestly mediation aspect."
