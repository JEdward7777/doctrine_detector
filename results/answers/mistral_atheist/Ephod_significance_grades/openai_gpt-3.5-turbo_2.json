The connection to the priesthood and worship practices in the Old Testament is effectively demonstrated, showing a good understanding of the importance of the ephod in religious rituals. The response could have benefited from a slightly more detailed explanation of the Urim and Thummim and their specific function in divine communication, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern given."
