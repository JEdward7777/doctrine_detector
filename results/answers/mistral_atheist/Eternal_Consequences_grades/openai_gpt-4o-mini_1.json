While it acknowledges the belief in eternal punishment in Hell for those who \"perish\" in Christianity, it falls short in emphasizing the seriousness of eternal separation from God as a consequence of perishing. A stronger connection to the eternal separation from God and the gravity of this consequence would have strengthened the overall Christian worldview perspective."
