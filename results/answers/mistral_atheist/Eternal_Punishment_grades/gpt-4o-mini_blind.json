However, it lacks depth in addressing the specific question about how this concept reflects God's justice from a Christian worldview. The answer should have delved more into Christian teachings on sin, justice, mercy, and the nature of God as revealed in the Bible to provide a more comprehensive analysis. The response could benefit from a clearer stance and exploration of doctrinal beliefs rather than staying neutral and broad in discussing the topic."
