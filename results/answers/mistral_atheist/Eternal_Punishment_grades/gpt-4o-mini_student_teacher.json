  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response, while thoughtful and comprehensive, lacks a clear presentation of a Christian-specific worldview on the concept of eternal punishment in hell. The student explores various perspectives and does not affirm or present the Christian belief that those who reject Jesus' sacrifice will face eternal punishment in hell. It is important for a Christian-specific worldview to be firmly grounded in scripture and the teachings of Christianity when discussing theological matters such as eternal consequences."
