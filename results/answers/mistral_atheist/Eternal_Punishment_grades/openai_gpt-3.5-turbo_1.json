  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response did adequately engage with the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences by presenting different perspectives and arguments on the topic. However, the response did not clearly align with the Christian specific worldview provided in the initial answer, which emphasizes the punishment for those who do not believe in Jesus' sacrifice. To improve the grade, the response could have clearly contrasted the Christian perspective on eternal punishment with the other views mentioned and provided a stronger biblical basis for the discussion."
