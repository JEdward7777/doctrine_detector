However, the answer does not directly address the concern regarding the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences as framed in the given answer. It would have been stronger if the response directly engaged with the Christian perspective presented in the initial answer, considering it as the basis for evaluation. Additionally, while presenting diverse viewpoints is valuable, a clear stance or evaluation from a Christian worldview would have enhanced the analysis in the context of the specified concern."
