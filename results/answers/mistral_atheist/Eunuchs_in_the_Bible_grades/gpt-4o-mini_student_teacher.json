They correctly identified the different categories of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus and linked celibacy as a choice for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The response could be improved by directly referencing the specific phrase \"eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\" from the teacher's reference answer and delving deeper into the theological significance of celibacy in light of Jesus' teachings on self-denial and devotion to God."
