  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-thought-out and comprehensive analysis of the passage from Matthew 19:12, acknowledging the biblical perspective on celibacy and the different reasons for living a life without marriage. The interpretation presented aligns with Christian teachings on celibacy and self-denial for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The integration of historical, cultural, and religious context adds depth to the analysis. Great job in addressing the concern with a Christian-specific worldview."
