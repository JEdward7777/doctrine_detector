  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and insightful analysis of the passage from Matthew 19:12, exploring the different interpretations of eunuchs in the Christian context, including those who are celibate for the kingdom of heaven. The student effectively addresses the concern regarding understanding the biblical perspective on celibacy and provides a well-supported explanation. However, to enhance the response further, more direct references to specific biblical passages on celibacy and marriage could have been included, deepening the theological analysis within a Christian worldview."
