However, as an atheist, the scholar could further explore the significance of exalting God from a Christian worldview and address the importance of placing God above all else in life, especially in relation to divine authority, obedience, and surrender to His will. Acknowledging and engaging with this specific concern more directly would have strengthened the analysis from a Christian worldview."
