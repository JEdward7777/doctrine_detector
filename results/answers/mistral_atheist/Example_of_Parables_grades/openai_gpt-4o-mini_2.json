  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively recognizes the moral lessons in Jesus' parables, specifically the Parable of the Hidden Treasure and the Parable of the Pearl of Great Value, and their relevance today. The explanation provided highlights the importance of prioritizing spiritual values over material possessions, which aligns well with Christian teachings on the Kingdom of Heaven. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on how these lessons can be applied in daily life or provide more examples of how prioritizing spiritual wealth over material wealth can lead to a fulfilling and meaningful life."
