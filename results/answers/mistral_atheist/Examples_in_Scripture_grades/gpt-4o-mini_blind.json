  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided an accurate and comprehensive list of examples from the Bible that illustrate instances of demon possession. They have referenced key passages and summarized the events well. The language used is clear and respectful of the biblical accounts. The only area for improvement would be to emphasize the significance of these instances within the overall Christian worldview, perhaps by highlighting how Jesus' authority over demons demonstrates His power and the spiritual battle that Christians believe exists."
