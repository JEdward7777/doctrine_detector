  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 90. The student provided detailed examples from the Bible that illustrate instances of demon possession, showing a good understanding of the topic. However, the answer could have been improved by directly referencing the concern of understanding the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith. By making this connection explicitly, the student could have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective in their response."
