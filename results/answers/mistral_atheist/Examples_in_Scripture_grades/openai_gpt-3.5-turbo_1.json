It demonstrates a good understanding of the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and effectively connects this to contemporary faith. However, it could have further elaborated on the relevance of these accounts for Christians today in terms of spiritual warfare, deliverance, and the power of Jesus over evil forces."
