The student effectively connects the examples given to the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Bible and their relevance to contemporary faith. The response could be improved by discussing how each of these examples reflects the broader spiritual themes present in the Bible and how they can be applied to contemporary faith practices. Overall, a strong demonstration of knowledge and critical thinking."
