1. Cain and Abel (Genesis 4:1-16): In this story, Cain and Abel, sons of Adam and Eve, offered sacrifices to God. God was pleased with Abel's offering but not with Cain's. Out of jealousy, Cain murdered his brother Abel. When God confronted Cain about Abel's death, Cain expressed guilt by saying, "I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, for whoever finds me may kill me."

2. Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:6-10): After eating the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve realized they were naked and sewed fig leaves together to make themselves loincloths. They also heard God walking in the garden, and they hid from Him among the trees. When God called out to Adam, he said, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."

3. King David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11-12): King David saw Bathsheba bathing and desired her. He sent messengers to get her, slept with her, and she became pregnant. When he found out that she was with child, he tried to cover up his sin by having her husband Uriah killed in battle. Prophet Nathan confronted David about his guilt, and the king repented.

4. Job (Job 1:6-2:10): God allowed Satan to test Job's righteousness by allowing him to suffer great loss and pain. In response to these trials, Job expressed deep feelings of guilt over his circumstances and questioned whether he had done anything wrong to deserve this punishment.

5. Peter's Denial (Matthew 26:69-75): After Jesus was arrested, Peter, one of His disciples, denied knowing Him three times. When the rooster crowed, Peter remembered his guilt and wept bitterly.

These examples demonstrate various aspects of guilt, such as remorse, fear of discovery, attempts to hide or cover up wrongdoings, and eventual repentance and acknowledgement of one's sins. They serve as lessons about the consequences of sin and the importance of honesty and integrity in religious and moral contexts.
