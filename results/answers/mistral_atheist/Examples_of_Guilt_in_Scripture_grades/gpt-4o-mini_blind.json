The references to Cain and Abel, Adam and Eve, King David and Bathsheba, Job, and Peter's Denial are appropriate and well-explained. The student effectively highlighted different aspects of guilt such as remorse, fear, attempts to hide wrongdoing, and repentance. Overall, a strong response demonstrating a good understanding of the concept of guilt as portrayed in biblical narratives. Great job!"
