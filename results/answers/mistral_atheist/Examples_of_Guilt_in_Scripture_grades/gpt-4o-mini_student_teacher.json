  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided well-explained examples from the Bible that demonstrate guilt, showing a good understanding of the concept within the Christian worldview. The examples were relevant and effectively highlighted different aspects of guilt, such as remorse, fear, and repentance. However, the concern specified the need for examples that emphasize the context of justice, innocence, and the need for divine judgment. While the student's examples do touch upon these themes, the reference answer provided by the teacher more directly aligns with the specified concern. Overall, the student's response is strong, but could further enhance the connection to justice and innocence for a higher grade."
