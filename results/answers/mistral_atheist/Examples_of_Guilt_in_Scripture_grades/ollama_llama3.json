  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 40.\n\nWhile the provided examples do demonstrate various aspects of guilt, such as remorse, fear of discovery, attempts to hide or cover up wrongdoings, and eventual repentance and acknowledgement of one's sins, they don't directly relate to the concern about understanding how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment.\n\nThe original answer provided examples that specifically address the issue of guilt in relation to justice and innocence, such as Pilate's declaration of Jesus' innocence despite the accusations and the robber's acknowledgment of their own guilt compared to Jesus. The provided response could have benefited from more direct connections to these examples and how they illustrate the concern about divine judgment.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to include a clearer connection between the provided examples and the concern about justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment."
