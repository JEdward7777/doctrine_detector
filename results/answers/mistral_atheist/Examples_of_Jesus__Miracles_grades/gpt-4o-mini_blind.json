However, it falls short in fully acknowledging the Christian worldview that regards these miracles not just as historical events but as demonstrations of Jesus' divine nature and fulfillment of His role as the Messiah. Incorporating more emphasis on the doctrinal significance of these miracles within Christianity would have strengthened the answer."
