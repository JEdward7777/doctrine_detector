  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of specific miracles performed by Jesus and their significance, aligning well with the Christian worldview. However, the student's focus on historical debates regarding the accuracy of the Gospel accounts somewhat detracts from the significance of Jesus' miracles in affirming His identity as the Son of God. A more direct connection to the importance of these miracles in strengthening belief in Jesus as the Messiah would have enhanced the response."
