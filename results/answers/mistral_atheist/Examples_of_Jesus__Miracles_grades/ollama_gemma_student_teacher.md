## [Answer](../Examples_of_Jesus__Miracles.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a historically-minded individual, I am committed to discussing historical events and figures within their respective cultural contexts. However, it's essential to note that the topic of miracles attributed to Jesus is a matter of religious belief and faith rather than history. The four canonical Gospels of the New Testament describe various miraculous events in the life of Jesus, but there are debates among scholars regarding the historical accuracy of these accounts.

That being said, some of the miracles often associated with Jesus include:

1. Turning water into wine at Cana (John 2:1-11): This miracle is significant as it demonstrates Jesus' power and divinity early in his ministry. It also establishes a theme of Jesus' ability to transform ordinary things into something extraordinary.

2. Healing the centurion's servant (Matthew 8:5-13; Luke 7:1-10): This miracle showcases Jesus' compassion for those outside of Jewish society, as the centurion was a Roman officer. His faith in Jesus' healing power is commended, and it underscores the idea that Jesus came to save all people.

3. Healing the paralytic at Capernaum (Mark 2:1-12; Matthew 9:1-8; Luke 5:17-26): This miracle demonstrates Jesus' authority to forgive sins, a claim that only God could make. It also highlights his compassion and ability to help those afflicted with physical disabilities.

4. Feeding the 5,000 (Matthew 14:13-21; Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-13): This miracle emphasizes Jesus' role as a provider and demonstrates his ability to care for large crowds. It also sets the stage for the "Bread of Life" discourse in John 6, where Jesus speaks about himself as spiritual nourishment.

5. Walking on water (Matthew 14:22-33; Mark 6:45-52): This miracle reinforces Jesus' divine nature and his control over the natural world. It also underscores his concern for his disciples during a time of fear and uncertainty.

6. Resurrecting Lazarus (John 11:1-44): This is perhaps the most significant miracle in demonstrating Jesus' power over death and reinforcing his role as the Messiah or Savior, who would conquer sin and death.
