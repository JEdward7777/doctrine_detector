  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response provides a comprehensive overview of Jesus' miracles, citing various biblical accounts and highlighting their significance in demonstrating Jesus' divinity, compassion, authority, and role as Savior. The examples given are all biblically-based and relevant to the concern of recognizing Jesus' divinity.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that it doesn't explicitly connect the miracles back to the larger story of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, which is important for demonstrating His true nature as the Son of God. Additionally, while the response acknowledges the significance of Jesus' miracles in showing His divinity, it could have gone further in explaining how these events testify to His true identity.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the importance of Jesus' miracles and their relevance to our faith."
