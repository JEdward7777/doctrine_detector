  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of several key miracles attributed to Jesus, highlighting their importance in showcasing Jesus' divinity and power. The examples given align well with the concern of recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles in strengthening belief in Him as the Son of God. However, to improve the grade, a deeper explanation of each miracle's specific theological significance and how they affirm Jesus as the Son of God would have been beneficial. Additionally, connecting each miracle to broader Christian theological concepts would have further strengthened the response."
