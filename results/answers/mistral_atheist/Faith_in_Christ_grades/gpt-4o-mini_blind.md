This belief is often based on the teachings found within the Bible, particularly the New Testament, which tells the story of Jesus' life, teachings, death, and resurrection.

In Christianity, faith in Christ signifies more than just intellectual assent; it is also about following His example of love, compassion, and service to others. It involves embracing a set of values, such as forgiveness, humility, and hope, that are expressed through Jesus' life and teachings. Furthermore, belief in Christ often includes repentance for one's sins, a commitment to live according to His teachings, and the expectation of eternal life with God.
