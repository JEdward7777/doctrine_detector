However, it lacks depth in explaining the foundational aspect of faith itself, which is essential for understanding the manifestations listed. It would have been beneficial to include points about the centrality of belief in Jesus as the Son of God, the importance of relationship with Him, and the role of the Holy Spirit in enabling these manifestations. Additionally, a more explicit reference to the necessity of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ could have strengthened the answer doctrinally."
