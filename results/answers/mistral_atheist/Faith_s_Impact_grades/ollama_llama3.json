  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive outline of what true faith in Jesus looks like, highlighting various aspects such as love and compassion, humility, service, prayer and worship, repentance and growth, hope and perseverance, and community and fellowship. While it does not directly address the concern about recognizing evidence of genuine faith in daily life, the response indirectly acknowledges this by emphasizing the importance of actions and transformation that accompany true faith.\n\nThe answer being graded is a good one, but it lacks specificity and detail in describing how the Holy Spirit's presence manifests in an individual's daily life. The response being evaluated does not provide concrete examples or illustrations to support its claims. Nevertheless, the outline presented in this response provides a solid foundation for understanding what true faith in Jesus looks like, making it deserving of an 85."
