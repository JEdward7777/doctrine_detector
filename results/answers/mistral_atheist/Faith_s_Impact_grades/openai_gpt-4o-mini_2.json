  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern of recognizing genuine faith in daily life by highlighting specific behaviors and characteristics that align with the statement provided. The detailed explanation of how true faith in Jesus manifests in actions and transformations, as outlined in the response, demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian beliefs and practices. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning the role of the Holy Spirit in producing these good spiritual fruits, but overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview."
