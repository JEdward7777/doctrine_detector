  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of how Christians are called to maintain integrity and faithfulness in their marriages based on biblical teachings. It effectively incorporates relevant passages from both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the importance of fidelity in marriage as a sacred covenant. The inclusion of specific verses such as Exodus 20:14, Matthew 5:27-28, and Ephesians 5:22-33 supports a clear and well-structured argument. The response could have further elaborated on practical ways Christians can actively uphold faithfulness in their marriages, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
