  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the term 'fellowship' in a Christian context, encompassing aspects of unity, love, mutual support, shared faith, spiritual bond, and gatherings for worship and mutual encouragement. While their response goes beyond the reference answer by providing additional depth and context, it effectively captures the essence of fellowship within a Christian worldview. Great job!"
