They accurately connected the concept to various examples from the Old Testament and highlighted the importance of obedience, faithfulness, and piety in receiving favor from God and others. However, the response could have been strengthened by including references to the New Testament and the role of Jesus Christ in mediating God's favor to believers. Additionally, a clearer distinction between earning favor through works and receiving God's unmerited favor (grace) could have enhanced the theological depth of the explanation."
