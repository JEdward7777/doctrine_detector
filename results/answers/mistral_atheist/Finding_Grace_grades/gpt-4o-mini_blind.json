However, from a Christian worldview, the emphasis on \"merited favor\" may not fully align with the doctrine of grace as understood in Christianity, where grace is often seen as unearned and unmerited favor from God. It would be beneficial for the student to delve deeper into the doctrinal nuances of grace within Christian theology for a more accurate representation."
