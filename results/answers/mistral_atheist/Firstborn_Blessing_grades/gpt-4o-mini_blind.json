The answer includes relevant examples from biblical narratives and connects them to modern Christian family dynamics. However, the response could be strengthened by explicitly highlighting the theological significance of Christ's role as the ultimate firstborn and heir, and how believers are adopted into God's family through faith in Him. This theological aspect is crucial in understanding the full depth of the concept of birthright within a Christian context."
