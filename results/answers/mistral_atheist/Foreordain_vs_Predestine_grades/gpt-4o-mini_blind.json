The student correctly highlights the broader sense in which \"foreordain\" is used in contrast to the specific individual implications of \"predestination.\" However, the response could be improved by emphasizing more distinctly the Calvinist perspective on predestination and referencing relevant biblical passages (such as Ephesians 1:5) to support the explanation. Additionally, the overall explanation could be more firmly grounded in the sovereignty of God and His eternal plan for His creation."
