  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-rounded and thoughtful response addressing the ways in which being 'bound' by sin can hinder a Christian's relationship with God, along with practical steps for finding freedom from these bonds. The answer aligns with Christian teachings on repentance, confession, and the grace of Jesus Christ. However, the response could have been more concise and focused to directly address the concern of encouraging believers to address sin for a deeper relationship with God, hence the slight deduction in the grade."
