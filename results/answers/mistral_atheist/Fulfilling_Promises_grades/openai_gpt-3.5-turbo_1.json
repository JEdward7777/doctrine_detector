  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation from a Christian perspective on the significance of keeping promises or vows made before God and the impact of failing to do so on one's faith. It effectively ties these concepts to biblical teachings and the importance of integrity, obedience, and trust in God. The explanation is clear, well-supported, and reflects a deep understanding of Christian values and beliefs. Great job!"
