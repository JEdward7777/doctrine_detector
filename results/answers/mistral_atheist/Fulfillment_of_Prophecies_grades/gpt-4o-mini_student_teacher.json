  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of how a prophecy is considered fulfilled in Biblical teaching, emphasizing the matching of the prophecy with actual events as confirmation of divine revelation. The student effectively discusses the role of detailed descriptions, symbols, and divine intervention in the fulfillment of prophecies. However, the student could strengthen their answer by explicitly linking the fulfillment of prophecies to God's direct intervention, as stated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
