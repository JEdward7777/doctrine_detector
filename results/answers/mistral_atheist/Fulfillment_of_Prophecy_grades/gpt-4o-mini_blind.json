The inclusion of specific Old Testament prophecies and their fulfillment in Jesus adds depth to the explanation. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the divine inspiration and infallibility of Scripture, highlighting that these prophecies were orchestrated by God Himself to point to Jesus as the fulfillment of His redemptive plan."
