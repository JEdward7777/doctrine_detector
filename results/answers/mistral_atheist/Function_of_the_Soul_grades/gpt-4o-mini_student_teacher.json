The student effectively explored the figurative language surrounding 'soul' and its importance in expressing emotions and personal experiences, aligning well with the concern provided. However, the student could have delved deeper into how acknowledging the figurative language surrounding 'soul' can lead to a deeper understanding of human experience from a biblical perspective, which would have enhanced the overall analysis."
