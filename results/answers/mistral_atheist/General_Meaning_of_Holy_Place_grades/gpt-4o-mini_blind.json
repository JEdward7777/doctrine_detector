  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 70. \n\nThe student has done a good job explaining how the term \"holy place\" can be understood in a broader context beyond the tabernacle or temple by referencing natural sites, pilgrimage sites, sacred spaces, and everyday spaces. However, the student missed the opportunity to emphasize the unique Christian perspective on holy places. A higher grade could have been achieved by incorporating more specific examples and references to Christian holy sites, such as Bethlehem, the Sea of Galilee, or the Garden of Gethsemane, and discussing the theological significance of these places in Christianity. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into how the concept of holy places in Christianity is rooted in the belief in the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers, making them temples of God. These omissions prevent the response from fully embracing a Christian worldview."
