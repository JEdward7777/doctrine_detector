  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 60. The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer regarding the broad understanding of \"holy places\" beyond tabernacles or temples. However, the Christian-specific worldview would emphasize that holy places are primarily those set apart for God's worship and sacred purpose. While the student's answer explores various cultural perspectives and places imbued with spiritual significance, it does not consistently tie back to the central Christian understanding of places dedicated to divine encounter. A Christian worldview would prioritize spaces specifically consecrated for worship, prayer, and spiritual communion with God. The student's response, while informative, could benefit from more explicit connections to this Christian perspective."
