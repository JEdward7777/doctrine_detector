  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a good overview of the differences between evangelists and other Christians based on general religious and cultural context. However, they did not address the concern of understanding the spiritual gifts related to evangelism and their role in the church, which is a crucial aspect of this topic from a Christian worldview. In a Christian perspective, evangelists are distinguished by being specially gifted to effectively share the Gospel with others. This key component was missing in the student's response, leading to a lower grade."
