  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately defines an evangelist and explains their role in Christianity. It also acknowledges the diversity within the Christian faith and the fact not all Christians are evangelists. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of spiritual gifts and their relation to evangelism from a Christian perspective."
