The answer aligns well with the concern provided, emphasizing the idea of a special spiritual gift for evangelism. However, it could have further expanded on the biblical basis for spiritual gifts, such as referencing 1 Corinthians 12:4-11, to provide a more comprehensive Christian worldview perspective."
