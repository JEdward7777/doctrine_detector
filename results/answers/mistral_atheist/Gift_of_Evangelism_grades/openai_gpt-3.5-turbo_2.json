  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the spiritual gift of evangelism and its role in the church. The student correctly identifies that some Christians are specially gifted as evangelists to effectively share the gospel with others. The response effectively addresses the concern regarding the understanding of spiritual gifts related to evangelism within a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a brief mention of the biblical basis for spiritual gifts, such as referencing 1 Corinthians 12 and Ephesians 4. Overall, a strong and well-supported explanation."
