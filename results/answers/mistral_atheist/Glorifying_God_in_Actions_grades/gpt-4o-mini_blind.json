While the suggestions are valid, the answer lacks depth and fails to emphasize the centrality of Jesus Christ in the believer's life. It also does not address the foundational importance of faith in Christ and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers to live a life that glorifies God. Additionally, it could have included the significance of sharing the Gospel and making disciples as essential components of glorifying God. Further development and integration of Christian principles and Scripture would strengthen the response."
