  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive list of ways believers may actively glorify God in their daily lives, which aligns well with the concern of emphasizing the importance of honoring God's greatness. The answer covers various aspects such as integrity, prayer, service to others, stewardship, pursuit of knowledge, forgiveness, and living according to principles. While these are all valid ways to glorify God, the reference answer specifically highlights sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments as central to reflecting His glory to others. Hence, the student's response, although thorough, could have been more focused on directly reflecting God's glory to others as the key aspect of glorifying God in daily life."
