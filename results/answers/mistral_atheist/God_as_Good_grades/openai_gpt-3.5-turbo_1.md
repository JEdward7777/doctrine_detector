## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Christian scriptures, the statement "There is only one who is good, and that is God" (Mark 10:18) can be interpreted as an affirmation of the divine nature of God. Jesus is emphasizing the moral perfection and goodness of God, suggesting that He is the ultimate standard of ethical conduct for humans to follow. This statement highlights the belief in a monotheistic tradition where there is only one supreme being who embodies all goodness. In a culturally retributed context, this quote demonstrates the emphasis on virtues such as compassion, love, and righteousness that are central to many cultures' moral systems.
