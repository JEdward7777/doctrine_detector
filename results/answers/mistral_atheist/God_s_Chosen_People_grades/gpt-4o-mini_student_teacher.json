  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response provides a general overview of the concept of a \"remnant\" in religious texts, but lacks depth in connecting it to God's selective grace towards His people. The answer touches on cultural and atheistic perspectives, but does not adequately address the significance of being chosen by God in the Christian worldview. There is a need for a stronger emphasis on God's sovereignty and purpose in choosing a remnant as a manifestation of His grace."
