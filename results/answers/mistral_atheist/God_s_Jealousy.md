## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In biblical context, the term "jealous" often doesn't carry the same connotation as in common usage today. Instead, it's more about divine passion or zeal for relationship rather than being envious or wrathful. The Hebrew word used is "qanas," which can imply a strong and protective love. In the Bible, God's jealousy is presented as a passionate desire for a faithful relationship with his people, warning them against idolatry and false worship.

This idea can be seen in passages such as Exodus 34:14 where it says, "Do not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God." Here, the emphasis is on God's exclusive claim over His people and their worship, rather than God being envious of other gods or objects.

However, interpretations may vary based on cultural, religious, and personal beliefs. This interpretation reflects a secular yet respectful approach to understanding the text within its historical and cultural context.
