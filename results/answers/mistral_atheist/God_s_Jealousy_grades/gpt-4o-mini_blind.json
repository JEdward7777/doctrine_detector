However, the answer could have been improved by emphasizing more on the divine aspect of jealousy as a righteous and just attribute of God, rather than downplaying it as merely a form of protective love. Additionally, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the sovereignty of God in demanding exclusive worship. Overall, while the answer is informative, it could have been more robust in presenting the concept of God's jealousy from a Christian worldview perspective."
