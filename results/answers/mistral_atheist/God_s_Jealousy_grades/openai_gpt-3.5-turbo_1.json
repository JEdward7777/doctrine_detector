The explanation aligns well with the Christian worldview by highlighting God's protective love and warning against idolatry. It effectively addresses the concern regarding understanding God's character and His desire for our spiritual fidelity. The only minor improvement could be a more explicit connection to how this concept of God's jealousy impacts our relationship with Him personally."
