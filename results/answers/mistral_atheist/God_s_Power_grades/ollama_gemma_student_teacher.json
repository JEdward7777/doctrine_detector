  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological concept of the Almighty. It correctly explains that the term signifies an all-powerful and authoritative God who has complete control over all things. Additionally, the student acknowledges the variation in interpretations of the term across different contexts. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to Christian scripture or theological perspectives to reinforce the Christian-specific worldview."
