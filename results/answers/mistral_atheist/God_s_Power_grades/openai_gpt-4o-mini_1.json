  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively articulates the definition of the term \"Almighty\" in connection to God's all-powerful nature and authority. It acknowledges the importance of understanding God's omnipotence in relation to faith and worship, demonstrating a clear grasp of the concern provided. The only minor critique is that the response could have further emphasized the unique and foundational role of God's omnipotence in shaping Christian beliefs and practices specifically."
