  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the term \"Almighty\" as signifying God's all-powerful nature and complete authority. It acknowledges the importance of understanding God's omnipotence in relation to faith and worship, demonstrating a solid understanding of the concern raised. The only minor critique is that the response could have included more Christian-specific references or examples to further enhance the explanation."
