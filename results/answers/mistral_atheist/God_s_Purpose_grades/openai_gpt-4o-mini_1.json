However, it falls short in addressing the specific concern raised about believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose or calling, which leads to spiritual uncertainty. The suggested methods do not directly address how to alleviate this spiritual uncertainty or provide reassurance to believers seeking guidance. Consider incorporating practical steps or scriptural references that directly speak to addressing spiritual uncertainty within the Christian faith."
