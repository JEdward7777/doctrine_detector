## [Answer](../God_s_Revelation.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, God introduces Himself using several names that reflect different aspects of His character and relationship with humanity. Here are a few examples:

1. Yahweh (יְהוָה) - This is probably the most famous name for God in the Old Testament, often transliterated as "Jehovah" or "YHWH." It is believed to be a form of the Hebrew verb "to be," signifying God's eternal and self-existent nature.

2. Elohim (אֱלֹהִים) - This word is used in the creation story in Genesis 1:1, where it says, "In the beginning God (Elohim) created the heavens and the earth." In this context, Elohim refers to the supreme deity of the Hebrew pantheon.

3. Adonai (אֲדוֹנַי) - This word means "Lord" in Hebrew and is often used as a title for God, particularly when followed by the name Yahweh. For example, in Exodus 6:2-3, God says to Moses, "I am the LORD [Adonai]. I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty [El Shaddai], but by my name [Yahweh] I did not make myself known to them."

4. El Shaddai (אֵל שַׁדַּי) - This is another significant name for God in the Old Testament, meaning "God Almighty" or "God of the Mountains." It is often associated with God's provision and protection.
