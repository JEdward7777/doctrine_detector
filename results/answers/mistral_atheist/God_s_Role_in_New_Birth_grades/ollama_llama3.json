It also acknowledges the importance of understanding the context and tenets of each tradition when discussing this topic. However, it does not directly address the concern about recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation, as emphasized by the given answer.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing a more explicit discussion of God's role in the process of being \"born again,\" particularly in the context of Christianity. For example, it could be noted that the Bible teaches that new birth is not achieved by human effort but by divine initiative (John 3:3-7), and that this divine initiative is rooted in God's love and grace towards humanity (Romans 5:8). By providing a more explicit discussion of God's sovereignty and grace, the response could better address the concern emphasized by the given answer."
