  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of God's punishment during the Day of the Lord, referencing numerous biblical passages and explaining the diverse interpretations among religious groups. It also acknowledges the absence of personal belief in the student's own worldview while respecting the beliefs of others. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the nature of God's wrath and its connection to the concept of punishment."
