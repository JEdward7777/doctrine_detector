However, as an atheistic scholar, the perspective on God's punishment lacks a Christian-specific worldview understanding. The response does not address the concern of recognizing the consequences for disbelief from a Christian perspective, which is essential for a comprehensive evaluation. Further discussion on the implications of God's judgment for disbelief within the Christian framework would have strengthened the response."
