However, as a Christian worldview specific concern is to be considered, the perspective of the atheistic scholar is not aligned with this worldview. From a Christian perspective, the understanding of God's judgment is that it is a righteous act based on His nature of holiness and justice. The response could be improved by highlighting the biblical teachings on the consequences of disbelief in a more central and accurate light within a Christian framework."
