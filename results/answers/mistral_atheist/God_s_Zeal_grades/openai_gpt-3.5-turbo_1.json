The answer aligns well with the given concern by emphasizing God's commitment to bless His people and ensure justice. However, there is room for improvement in connecting the concept of God's zeal to deepening believers' trust in His commitment to their well-being more explicitly. Further exploration of how recognizing God's zeal can impact believers' faith and trust would enhance the response."
