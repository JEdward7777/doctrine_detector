However, the connection to recognizing God's zeal as a means to deepen believers' trust in His commitment to their well-being could have been emphasized more clearly and from a Christian worldview perspective. The response could have elaborated more on how understanding God's zeal in this context can strengthen faith and reliance on His promises."
