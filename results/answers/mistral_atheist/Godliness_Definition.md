## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, 'godliness' is often defined as a lifestyle characterized by obedience to God's commands and a deep reverence for Him. It involves living according to God's moral standards and values, which are outlined throughout the Old and New Testaments.

In 1 Timothy 2:3-4, it says that "God our Savior... desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth." This suggests that godliness is not just about following rules, but also about seeking truth and salvation through a relationship with God.

In Titus 2:11-12, it says that "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age." Here, we see a focus on renouncing ungodly behaviors and living a life that reflects God's character.

In 1 Peter 2:9, it says that believers are "a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light." This suggests that godliness is not just about personal behavior, but also about living a life that reflects God's glory and proclaiming His excellence to others.

In summary, in the context of living one's life, the Bible defines 'godliness' as a lifestyle characterized by obedience to God's commands, seeking truth and salvation through a relationship with Him, renouncing ungodly behaviors, and living a self-controlled, upright, and godly life that reflects God's character and proclaims His excellence.
