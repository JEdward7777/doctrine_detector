  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a thorough explanation of 'godliness' using multiple Bible verses to support their points, they could improve by focusing more on practical ways to incorporate godliness into daily life and actions. The student does touch on renouncing ungodly behaviors and living a godly life, but they could provide more specific examples or guidance on how individuals can actively live out godliness in their daily lives. Encouraging practical application and providing specific suggestions would enhance the answer and provide clearer direction for incorporating godliness in daily actions.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of godliness as defined in the Bible and supports their points effectively with scripture references. With a stronger emphasis on practical application, the answer would better address the concern for clarity on incorporating godliness into daily life and actions."
