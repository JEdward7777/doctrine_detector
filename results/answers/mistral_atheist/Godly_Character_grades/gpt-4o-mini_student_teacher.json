  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student accurately identified the fruits of the Holy Spirit according to Christian theology, as outlined in Galatians 5:22-23. However, the student's response falls short in addressing the concern of understanding the characteristics of a godly individual and how to cultivate them. Their mention of these traits being admirable in various contexts was a good addition, but the focus should have been more on the Christian perspective on cultivating these qualities within oneself through the work of the Holy Spirit."
