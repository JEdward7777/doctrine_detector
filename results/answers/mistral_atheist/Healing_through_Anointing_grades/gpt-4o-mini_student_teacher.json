  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding the practice of anointing related to healing in the New Testament. They effectively connected the significance of anointing to consecration, healing, and spiritual preparation, drawing from both Old Testament and New Testament examples. However, they could have more directly addressed the concern by emphasizing the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice, similar to the reference answer given by the teacher."
