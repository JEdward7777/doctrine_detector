# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the New Testament, anointing is a ritual act that signifies consecration, healing, and spiritual preparation. This practice was not unique to Christianity but was also found in Jewish customs, where anointing with oil was used for various purposes such as dedication, coronation, and healing.

The connection between anointing and healing can be traced back to the Old Testament, particularly in the books of Exodus and Isaiah. For example, in Exodus 30:22-33, Moses is instructed to make a sacred anointing oil for use in the tabernacle and on Aaron and his sons, who were consecrated as priests. In this context, anointing was a means of setting apart or consecrating individuals for specific roles, such as healing.

In the New Testament, Jesus is portrayed as performing healings and using anointing oil in a symbolic way to demonstrate his compassion and power over disease and sickness. For instance, in Mark 6:13, it is stated that Jesus "cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them." Here, the act of anointing is closely linked with healing, demonstrating a spiritual connection between the two.

Furthermore, in the New Testament, anointing is also associated with the Holy Spirit. In Acts 10:38, it is written that Jesus "went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses of all that he did both in Judea and Galilee at the beginning of his ministry." In this passage, anointing with the Holy Spirit is seen as a means through which Jesus performed healings.

In summary, the practice of anointing in the New Testament is related to healing in that it signifies consecration, spiritual preparation, and power over disease and sickness. The act of anointing serves as a symbolic reminder of God's presence and compassion, particularly in Jesus' ministry on Earth.
