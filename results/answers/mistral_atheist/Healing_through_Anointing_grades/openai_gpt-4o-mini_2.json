It acknowledges the role of anointing in seeking God's intervention and healing power, aligning with Christian beliefs in healing through faith. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention the connection between anointing and the Holy Spirit in facilitating healing, as seen in Acts 10:38."
