## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the ancient Hebrew tradition as described in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible and the Torah of the Jewish faith, the Ark of the Covenant was a sacred object that housed the Tablets of Stone upon which the Ten Commandments were written. Access to the Ark was highly restricted due to its divine nature and association with the presence of God.

Only three groups of people were allowed to approach the Ark: the priests, specifically the Kohathites, who were responsible for transporting it; the Levites, who served as assistants during this transportation; and Moses, Aaron, and their descendants. However, these interactions had specific rituals and precautions that needed to be followed to avoid any harm or punishment.

The most notable restriction was that the Ark could not be touched directly by anyone. In Numbers 4:15, God instructed the Kohathites through Moses as follows: "When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all its furnishings, and the tabernacle has been taken down, then the Kohathites shall come to carry these; but they must not touch the holy things or they will die."

Under ordinary circumstances, the Ark of the Covenant was kept inside the Holy of Holies within the Tabernacle (and later the Temple in Jerusalem), accessible only to the High Priest once a year during the Day of Atonement. Approaching and interacting with the Ark under any other circumstances could result in severe consequences, as emphasized by the story of Uzzah, who reached out to steady the Ark when it appeared to be tipping and was immediately struck dead (2 Samuel 6:1-7).
