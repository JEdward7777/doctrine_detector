  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and accurate understanding of the restrictions surrounding the approach to the Ark of the Covenant in ancient Hebrew tradition as described in the Old Testament. The student effectively explains the limited groups of people allowed to approach the Ark and the specific rituals and precautions that needed to be followed. Additionally, the inclusion of scriptural references further supports the explanation. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
