  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the restrictions and rituals surrounding the Ark of the Covenant, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic. However, the student missed the key point of the high priest being the only one allowed to approach the ark, deviating from the specific concern provided. This oversight led to a deduction in the grade."
