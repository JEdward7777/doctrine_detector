  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the restrictions and qualifications for approaching the Ark of the Covenant within the Christian worldview. They correctly identify the specific groups permitted to handle the Ark and explain the associated rituals and precautions. The inclusion of the story of Uzzah reinforces the severe consequences of unauthorized or improper interaction with the sacred object. While the answer aligns with the reference answer, it could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of the High Priest's unique access and the symbolic importance of the Day of Atonement."
