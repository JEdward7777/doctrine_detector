However, the response oversimplifies and inaccurately represents the complexity of the Ark's handling and interaction in the ancient Hebrew tradition. The response does not mention the other two groups allowed to approach the Ark (priests and Levites) or the specific rituals and precautions that needed to be followed to avoid harm or punishment.\n\nTo improve, the response could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of the high priest and the Ark's significance in the Israelite's relationship with God."
