## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of both Isaiah and Amos, the term "remnant" refers to a small group or survivors who are chosen by God to carry on His purpose after a judgment or disaster. This concept is deeply rooted in the Old Testament and serves as a powerful symbol of hope amidst destruction.

1) The Fall of Jerusalem (Isaiah 1:9): Isaiah 1:9 states, "Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah." This passage highlights God's mercy in sparing a remnant of His people during the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians.

2) The Exile and Return (Isaiah 40:3): Isaiah 40:3 prophesies about the return of exiles to Jerusalem, saying, "In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God." This passage emphasizes that even though the Israelites were taken into exile, a remnant would return and restore their relationship with God.

3) The Destruction of the Northern Kingdom (Amos 9:15): Amos 9:15 says, "I will plant them on their land, and they shall never again be uprooted from the land I have given them," indicating that despite the impending destruction of the Northern Kingdom, a remnant would survive and return to rebuild.

In each of these examples, the idea of the 'remnant' offers hope for God's chosen people during times of turmoil and chaos. The concept underscores God's covenant with His people and His commitment to maintain a relationship with them even when they stray from His path.
