It correctly mentions the practical and symbolic reasons behind this practice and ties it back to the biblical account in the Book of Exodus. The explanation of the symbolic significance of unleavened bread in representing the haste of the Israelites' departure and freedom from oppression is well articulated. However, from a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial to also emphasize how this event in Jewish history points forward to Christ as the ultimate Passover Lamb who frees believers from the bondage of sin. Additionally, highlighting the foreshadowing of the New Testament fulfillment of these Old Testament practices could enhance the answer."
