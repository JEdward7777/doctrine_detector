However, the concern specified a need to recognize the historical events that shape religious practices, and the student, while acknowledging the importance of the story within Judaism, did not directly attribute the reason for eating unleavened bread to God's instruction as the reference answer stated. In a Christian worldview, understanding that God instructed the Israelites to flee quickly without waiting for their bread to rise is essential in recognizing the foundational role of divine intervention in shaping religious practices."
