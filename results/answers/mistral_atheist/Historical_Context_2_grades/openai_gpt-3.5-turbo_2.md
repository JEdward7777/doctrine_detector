## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar, I approach historical and cultural questions from a perspective of evidence-based analysis. The story of the Israelites eating unleavened bread during their Exodus from Egypt is found in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the Book of Exodus (12:15-20).

The reason given for this practice is rooted in both practical and symbolic reasons within the context of that time. The Israelites were required to leave Egypt so hastily that there was no time for their dough to rise, thus they ate unleavened bread or matzah. This has become known as the Feast of Unleavened Bread, or Passover, which is still celebrated by Jews today as one of their most important holidays.

The symbolic significance lies in the fact that unleavened bread represents the quickness and simplicity of the Israelites' departure from Egypt. They were to be free from their oppressors, just as leaven (yeast) can represent corruption or sin within Jewish thought. By eating unleavened bread, the Israelites commemorated their liberation and renewed their commitment to living a life free from bondage and sin.

It is essential to recognize that this story carries deep cultural and religious meaning for Judaism, but its interpretation can vary widely among different Jewish communities and scholars.
