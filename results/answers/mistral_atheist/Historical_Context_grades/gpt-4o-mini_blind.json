The examples chosen are relevant and well-explained. However, the response could benefit from incorporating more direct references to the specific passages in Amos regarding the remnant, as is done with the Isaiah passages. Additionally, emphasizing the theological significance of the remnant concept in relation to God's covenant and faithfulness could strengthen the overall analysis."
