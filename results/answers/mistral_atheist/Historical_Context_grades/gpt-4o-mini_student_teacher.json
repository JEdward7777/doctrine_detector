  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of biblical events in Isaiah and Amos that illustrate the concept of the remnant. They effectively tie these events to God's promises and covenant with His people. However, the student could deepen their analysis by focusing more on the historical significance of the remnant in relation to God's promises, as specified in the concern. Nevertheless, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical concept of remnant in the context of Isaiah and Amos."
