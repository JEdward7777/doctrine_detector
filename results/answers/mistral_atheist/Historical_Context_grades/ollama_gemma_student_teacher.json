  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of \"remnant\" in Isaiah and Amos, supported by relevant biblical passages. The connection between the concept and God's covenant is clearly articulated, along with the idea of hope amidst destruction.
