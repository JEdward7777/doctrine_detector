  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of a remnant in Isaiah and Amos, particularly in regards to God's promises. The examples provided from each book effectively illustrate how the idea of a remnant offers hope during times of turmoil and chaos. The response also correctly highlights God's covenant with His people as a central theme.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by providing more specific analysis and application of the concept of a remnant in relation to God's promises. While the response mentions persistence in God's covenant, it would benefit from more explicit connections between the idea of a remnant and God's historical promises to His people.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively explores the significance of a remnant in Isaiah and Amos, but could be taken to an even higher level by providing more nuanced analysis and application."
