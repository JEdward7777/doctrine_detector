  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that effectively explains the influence of the Roman practice of crucifixion on the perception of the cross in early Christianity. They touched on the symbolism of Jesus' suffering and sacrifice, the redemptive aspect of the crucifixion, and the evolution of the cross as a central Christian symbol. However, the student could improve their grade by integrating more focus on the transformation of the symbol from one of shame and suffering to one of hope, victory, and eternal life through Jesus' resurrection, as emphasized in the reference answer."
