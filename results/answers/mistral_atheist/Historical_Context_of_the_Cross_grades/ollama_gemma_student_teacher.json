The response effectively explains the initial association of the cross with shame and suffering, but highlights how early Christianity transformed it into a symbol of hope, victory, and eternal life through Jesus' resurrection. The inclusion of textual evidence from the New Testament and early Christian writings further strengthens the argument."
