# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The Roman practice of crucifixion significantly influenced the perception of the cross in early Christianity, given that Jesus Christ was believed to have been crucified by the Romans. Crucifixion was a brutal and public form of execution primarily used by the Romans as a means of punishment and deterrence. The victims were often criminals or political dissidents.

The act of crucifying Jesus on a cross would have carried great significance for early Christians, as it served as a powerful symbol of Jesus' suffering and sacrifice. This interpretation is supported in the New Testament, where the crucifixion is portrayed as an act of redemption. For example, St. Paul writes in Galatians 3:13 that "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.'"

The cross became a potent and enduring symbol of Christianity, representing not only Jesus' death but also his resurrection and eventual triumph over sin and evil. In this way, the Roman practice of crucifixion had a profound impact on the early development of Christian beliefs and values.

It is important to note that the cross was not always universally accepted as a symbol of Christianity in its earliest days. The fish symbol (an acronym for "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior") was more commonly used by some early Christian communities to avoid persecution. However, as Christianity spread and became more established, the cross came to be embraced as one of its most recognizable symbols.

Ultimately, the Roman practice of crucifixion left a lasting imprint on Christianity, shaping its theology, iconography, and cultural identity in profound ways.
