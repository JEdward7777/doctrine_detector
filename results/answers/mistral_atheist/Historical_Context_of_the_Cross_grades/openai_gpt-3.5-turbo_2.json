The inclusion of scriptural references and the acknowledgement of the initial resistance to using the cross as a symbol enriches the analysis. The Christian-specific worldview is evident in discussing the redemptive significance of Jesus' crucifixion in relation to the Christian message of salvation and victory over sin. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern raised."
