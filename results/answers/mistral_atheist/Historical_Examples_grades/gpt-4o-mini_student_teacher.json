  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-detailed answer, citing multiple examples of individuals from the Bible who built altars and explaining the significance of those acts in relation to covenant-making, gratitude, atonement, and dedication to God. The examples given show a good understanding of the topic and how these historical acts can inspire Christians in their faith and worship practices. The only area for improvement would be to include a concluding statement that ties the examples back to the concern provided."
