  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the significance of building altars in the Bible. It provides detailed examples of individuals who built altars and the associated purposes. The response also acknowledges the cultural and religious contexts of these acts, which adds nuance to the discussion. However, the inclusion of Noah's altar would have strengthened the answer as it is missing from the reference answer provided by the teacher."
