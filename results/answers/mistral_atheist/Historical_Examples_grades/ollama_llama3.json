However, it does not explicitly address the concern about inspiring Christians to express their faith through worship. While the response does mention the significance of altars in biblical contexts, it could have more directly connected these historical examples to modern-day practices of worship and devotion. Additionally, there is no explicit discussion of how learning from these examples can inform Christian lives today. Nevertheless, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the cultural and religious context of altar-building in the Bible, making it a good starting point for exploring this topic further."
