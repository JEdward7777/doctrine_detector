  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:** \n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and sensitive approach to introducing the concept of the Holy Spirit in unfamiliar contexts. It acknowledges the cultural sensitivity and avoids rigid theological jargon while still conveying the essential nature of the Holy Spirit as part of the Trinity. The examples and analogies provided are helpful in bridging the gap between Christian theology and non-Christian perspectives. Overall, this is a well-written and insightful response that addresses the concern for clear and contextual teaching."
