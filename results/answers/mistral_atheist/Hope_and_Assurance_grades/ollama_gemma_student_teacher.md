## [Answer](../Hope_and_Assurance.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of the Bible, the absence of hope can be associated with various themes such as despair, fear, and spiritual poverty. The Book of Psalms often expresses feelings of sorrow, longing for God's presence, or a sense of hopelessness in times of hardship (e.g., Psalm 42:11). However, it is important to note that these feelings are not endorsed as ideal or permanent states but rather serve as starting points for faith and prayer.

In the New Testament, Jesus frequently preached messages of hope, healing, and redemption (e.g., Matthew 5:3-12, John 14:1-6). He often comforted his followers by reminding them that faith in Him would provide an eternal hope (John 14:1-6).

One significant passage related to this topic can be found in Romans 5:1-5, where the Apostle Paul discusses the relationship between hope and faith. He suggests that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through Him, we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God.

In conclusion, while the Bible acknowledges feelings of hopelessness, it encourages its followers to find hope in their faith in God, His love, and the promises of salvation offered through Jesus Christ.
