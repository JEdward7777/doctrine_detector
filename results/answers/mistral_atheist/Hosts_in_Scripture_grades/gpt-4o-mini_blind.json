The mention of different translations and the importance of context is commendable. The answer could be improved by emphasizing that these celestial beings, while subordinate to God, are not on the same level as Him. Additionally, a clearer connection to the overarching theme of divine authority and order within the heavenly realm would strengthen the response."
