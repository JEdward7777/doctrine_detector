  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a generally accurate explanation of the term \"hosts\" in Scripture, they did not mention the crucial aspect of celestial bodies like stars and planets being included in the term, as the reference answer did. This omission is significant in understanding the full scope of what \"hosts\" can encompass in a Christian worldview. Additionally, although the student mentioned the variety of celestial beings encompassed by the term, they could have elaborated more on the implications of this for spiritual warfare and the believer's perspective on prayer and battles in the spiritual realm. Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding but lacks a full alignment with the Christian worldview regarding the term 'hosts'."
