## [Answer](../Hosts_in_Scripture.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of Scripture, particularly in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible and the Hebrew Bible, the term "hosts" (often translated from Hebrew as "sarim" or "benei ha'elohim," and from Greek as "strateia") is used to refer to a variety of celestial beings. These can include angels, who are often described as messengers of God or guardians of humanity, as well as other divine or semi-divine entities. The specific meaning can depend on the context, but generally, it encompasses supernatural beings subordinate to the one supreme deity. It's important to note that interpretations may vary based on cultural, religious, and historical contexts.
