  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of \"hosts\" in Scripture, accurately mentioning that it can refer to angels, other divine or semi-divine entities, and celestial bodies. The mention of context-dependent meanings is also relevant to our concern about spiritual warfare and divine authority.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples from Scripture and exploring how these different types of hosts relate to spiritual warfare and divine authority. For instance, what role do angels play in defending believers or waging war against demonic forces? How do celestial bodies reflect God's creative power and majesty?\n\nOverall, while this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the concept of \"hosts\" in Scripture, it could be strengthened by more explicitly linking these concepts to our concern about spiritual warfare and divine authority."
