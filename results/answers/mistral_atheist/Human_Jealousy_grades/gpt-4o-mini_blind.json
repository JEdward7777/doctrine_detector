  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 75. The answer provides practical and sensible advice on handling feelings of jealousy in relationships, emphasizing self-awareness, communication, empathy, trust, boundaries, self-improvement, patience, and forgiveness. However, from a Christian perspective, there is a lack of emphasis on seeking God's guidance, surrendering emotions to Him, and relying on His strength to overcome jealousy. Additionally, biblical principles such as love, faith, and submitting to one another in humility could have been integrated more explicitly into the response. Overall, while the answer is comprehensive and respectful, it could be strengthened by incorporating Christian teachings on jealousy and relationships."
