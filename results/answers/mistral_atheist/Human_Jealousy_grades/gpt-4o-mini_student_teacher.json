They emphasized self-awareness, communication, empathy, establishing trust and boundaries, self-improvement, patience, and forgiveness, which are all valuable steps in handling jealousy effectively. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of evaluating the health of the relationship and striving for open communication and trust, as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. Integrating more explicitly Christian principles such as forgiveness, grace, and seeking God's guidance in overcoming jealousy could also enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
