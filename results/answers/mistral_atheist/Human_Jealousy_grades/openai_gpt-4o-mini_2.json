  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 85.\n\nWhile the response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to addressing feelings of jealousy in relationships, it falls slightly short of fully integrating the Christian worldview perspective. Within a Christian worldview, jealousy can be seen as a manifestation of sinful desires such as coveting or lack of contentment. The response could have delved deeper into addressing these spiritual aspects and emphasized seeking God's guidance and grace in overcoming jealousy. Additionally, the importance of forgiveness and seeking reconciliation through Christ's example could have been highlighted more explicitly.\n\nOverall, the response offers valuable insights and practical advice, but could have been strengthened by incorporating more explicitly Christian principles and perspectives."
