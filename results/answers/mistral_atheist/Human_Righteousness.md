## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christianity, a person is declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ, as stated in various passages of the New Testament. This concept is often referred to as "justification by faith."

According to Paul's teachings in Romans 3:21-30, this righteousness comes from God's grace and is a gift that is received through faith in Jesus Christ, who is considered to be the atoning sacrifice for sin. This faith is understood as more than intellectual assent; it involves trusting and relying on Jesus for salvation.

Ephesians 2:8-9 also reinforces this idea by stating that it is God's grace that saves us, not our works, and that we are saved by faith, which is a gift from God.

In summary, according to the Christian faith, a person can be declared righteous (justified) by putting their faith in Jesus Christ as the atoning sacrifice for sin, recognizing that this righteousness is a gift of grace from God and not something earned through good works or personal effort.
