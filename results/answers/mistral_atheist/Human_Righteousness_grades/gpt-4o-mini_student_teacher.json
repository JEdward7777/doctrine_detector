  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ according to Christian beliefs, referencing key passages from the New Testament. They accurately highlighted the essential aspects of salvation through faith in Jesus as the atoning sacrifice for sin. However, the student's answer could have been improved by emphasizing more explicitly that it is through trust in Jesus and acceptance of His righteousness that a person is declared righteous, as outlined in the reference answer."
