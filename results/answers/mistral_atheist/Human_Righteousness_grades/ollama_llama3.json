  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of explaining the concept of justification by faith in Christianity, citing relevant Scripture passages and emphasizing that righteousness comes from God's grace and is received through faith in Jesus Christ. The summary at the end effectively condenses the main point into a concise statement.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly tying the idea of trusting in Jesus to save them to the specific concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus. While the response does mention that God attributes Jesus' righteousness to those who trust in Him, it would be helpful to see a more direct connection made between this concept and the importance of understanding salvation.\n\nOverall, the response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the biblical teaching on justification by faith, but could benefit from a bit more attention to the specific concern being addressed."
