## Question [Human Righteousness](../../../questions/Human_Righteousness.md)
How can a person be declared righteous according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
A person can be declared righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them, as God cleanses them from their sins and attributes Jesusâ€™ righteousness to them.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is essential for understanding salvation.

## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christianity, a person is declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ, as stated in various passages of the New Testament. This concept is often referred to as "justification by faith."

According to Paul's teachings in Romans 3:21-30, this righteousness comes from God's grace and is a gift that is received through faith in Jesus Christ, who is considered to be the atoning sacrifice for sin. This faith is understood as more than intellectual assent; it involves trusting and relying on Jesus for salvation.

Ephesians 2:8-9 also reinforces this idea by stating that it is God's grace that saves us, not our works, and that we are saved by faith, which is a gift from God.

In summary, according to the Christian faith, a person can be declared righteous (justified) by putting their faith in Jesus Christ as the atoning sacrifice for sin, recognizing that this righteousness is a gift of grace from God and not something earned through good works or personal effort.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response does a good job of explaining the concept of justification by faith in Christianity, citing relevant Scripture passages and emphasizing that righteousness comes from God's grace and is received through faith in Jesus Christ. The summary at the end effectively condenses the main point into a concise statement.

However, the response could be improved by more explicitly tying the idea of trusting in Jesus to save them to the specific concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus. While the response does mention that God attributes Jesus' righteousness to those who trust in Him, it would be helpful to see a more direct connection made between this concept and the importance of understanding salvation.

Overall, the response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the biblical teaching on justification by faith, but could benefit from a bit more attention to the specific concern being addressed.
