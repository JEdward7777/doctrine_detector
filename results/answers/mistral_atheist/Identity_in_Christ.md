## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In religious texts, the phrase "I have called you by name" often symbolizes a personal and intimate relationship between the deity and the person being addressed. However, since I am an atheistic scholar, my interpretation is not grounded in theistic beliefs.

From a secular perspective, this phrase can be seen as a metaphor for self-realization or identity development. It suggests that one has found their unique purpose or calling in life, and they are known and valued by others due to their distinct qualities and contributions.

In this sense, the phrase could be rephrased to something like "You have discovered your personal mission" or "Your individual talents and accomplishments set you apart." This interpretation emphasizes the importance of self-awareness, purposeful living, and community recognition for personal fulfillment and societal growth.
