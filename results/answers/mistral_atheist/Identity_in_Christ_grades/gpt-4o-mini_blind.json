From a Christian worldview, this phrase is deeply rooted in the belief that God knows each individual personally and has a specific purpose and plan for their life. The answer fails to address the relational aspect of God calling someone by name and the divine significance of being known intimately by the Creator. It is essential to engage with the theological implications of such a statement when discussing it from a Christian worldview."
