  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely misses the mark in addressing the concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ.

The student's failure to engage with the specific theme and lack of relevance to the Christian perspective significantly impacts the grade."
