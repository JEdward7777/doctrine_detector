## [Answer](../Identity_of_Jesus.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian belief, the name 'Jesus' (Iesous in Greek) is derived from the Hebrew name Yeshua, which means "God saves." The purpose or role of Jesus in Christianity is significant and multi-faceted.

According to the New Testament, Jesus was born as a human being, lived a sinless life, and performed miracles to demonstrate His divine nature. However, the most essential aspect of His purpose, according to Christian belief, is His crucifixion and resurrection. By willingly suffering and dying on the cross, Jesus, according to Christian belief, atoned for the sins of humanity.

The resurrection of Jesus from death, as recorded in the New Testament, signifies that He conquered sin and death, providing a path for humans to have eternal life with God. Thus, in Christian understanding, Jesus' purpose was not only to demonstrate the love and power of God but also to reconcile humanity to God, offering salvation and everlasting life through faith in Him.

It is essential to remember that interpretations can vary greatly among different Christian denominations and individuals. The above explanation represents a broad overview based on the beliefs commonly held by mainstream Christian churches.
