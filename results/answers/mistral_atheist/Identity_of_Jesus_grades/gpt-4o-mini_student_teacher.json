  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer to the question, demonstrating a solid understanding of the significance of Jesus's name and His role as Savior from a Christian perspective. The explanation accurately reflects mainstream Christian beliefs regarding Jesus' purpose and the significance of His crucifixion and resurrection in providing salvation. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning that the name 'Jesus' means 'Yahweh saves,' which is the specific signification indicated in the reference answer."
