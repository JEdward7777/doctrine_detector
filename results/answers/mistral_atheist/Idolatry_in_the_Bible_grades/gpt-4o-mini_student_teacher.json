  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided relevant examples from the Bible that illustrate the consequences of idolatry among God's people, they could have strengthened their answer by including more direct references to the specific consequences faced by the individuals or communities involved. Additionally, the student could have linked each example more explicitly to the overarching theme of consequences resulting from straying from God's commandments. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could have provided a more focused and cohesive response."
