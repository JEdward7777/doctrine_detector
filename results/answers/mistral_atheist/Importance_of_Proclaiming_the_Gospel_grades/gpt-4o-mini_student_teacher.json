  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out answer, addressing various aspects of why it is important for Christians to proclaim the \"Good News\" from a Christian perspective. The student correctly highlighted the importance of sharing God's love, the obligation to witness based on the Great Commission, the role of evangelism and discipleship, the message of salvation and eternal life through Jesus Christ, and the transformative power of the Gospel. However, the student's answer did not directly reference Jesus' instruction before His return to heaven as the primary reason for the importance of proclaiming the Good News, as emphasized in the reference answer. This key point should be more explicitly incorporated for a higher grade."
