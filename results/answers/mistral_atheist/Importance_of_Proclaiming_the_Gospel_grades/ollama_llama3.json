  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response addresses the concern by referencing Jesus' instruction to proclaim the Good News before his return, which shows an awareness of the mandate to spread the Gospel message. However, it lacks depth and does not fully develop the importance of proclaiming the Good News as outlined in the provided answer. The response also does not explore the various aspects of sharing God's love, obligation to witness, evangelism and discipleship, salvation and eternal life, or transformation that are mentioned in the original text.\n\nA higher score could be achieved if the response expanded on the reasons why proclaiming the Good News is important, incorporating some of the key points from the provided answer."
