  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the roles of the Sadducees and Pharisees in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus, highlighting their differing beliefs and motivations. However, the student's answer focused more on the historical and social context rather than emphasizing the selfishness and hypocrisy of the religious leaders, as pointed out in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to further integrate the Christian worldview by emphasizing the moral failings of the Sadducees and Pharisees in influencing Jesus' crucifixion."
