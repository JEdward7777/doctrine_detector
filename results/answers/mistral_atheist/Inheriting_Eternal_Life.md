## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 According to the New Testament of the Bible, particularly in the Gospel of Mark (10:17-30), it is stated that inheriting eternal life requires following God's commandments and showing love towards others. This includes commandments such as not killing, stealing, committing adultery, bearing false witness against your neighbor, and coveting anything that belongs to them (Exodus 20:13-17).

However, Jesus also emphasized that these commandments are summarized in the two great commandments: loving God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and loving your neighbor as yourself (Mark 12:28-31). In the Gospel of John (3:16), it is written that whoever believes in Him (Jesus) will have eternal life.

It's important to note that interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations and scholars. This summary is a general understanding based on the text itself.
