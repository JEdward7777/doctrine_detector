  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive response citing relevant passages from the Bible to support their answer.

The inclusion of key verses from the New Testament strengthens their argument. However, the response could have been further improved by directly referencing the specific interaction between Jesus and the expert in Jewish law as the reference answer did."
