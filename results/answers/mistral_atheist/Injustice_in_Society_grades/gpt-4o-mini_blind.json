  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student has provided a comprehensive list of examples of injustice in the world today and offered some general responses that align with common ethical principles. However, the response lacks specificity in connecting these issues to a distinctly Christian worldview. To improve, the student should incorporate more explicit references to biblical teachings, such as citing specific scripture passages or theological principles that inform a Christian response to injustice. Additionally, the response could deepen by emphasizing the transformative power of the Gospel and the importance of repentance, redemption, and restoration in addressing societal injustices. Overall, while the student's suggestions are generally sound, there is a need for greater integration of Christian beliefs and values in their analysis and recommendations."
