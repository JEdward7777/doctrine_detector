  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of examples of injustice in our world today and suggested various responses that align with common ethical principles. However, the student failed to address the concern specifically emphasizing the need for Christian activism against injustice and promoting fairness based on biblical principles. The answer lacked a clear emphasis on advocating for justice, demonstrating mercy, and acting righteously, as instructed by the reference answer. The student should have incorporated more explicitly Christian perspectives and principles throughout their response."
