  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and comprehensive analysis of various forms of global injustice, aligning well with the concern for Christian activism against injustice based on biblical principles. The suggested potential responses from a Christian perspective are rooted in the teachings of Jesus and emphasize practical actions to address injustice. However, to improve the grade, the response could explicitly reference specific biblical passages or teachings that support the advocacy for justice, mercy, and righteousness in the face of injustice. Overall, the response effectively integrates Christian principles with a call to action against injustice."
