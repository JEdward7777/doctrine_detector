However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the foundational premise that there is no divine being or supernatural intervention contradicts the core belief in God's existence and involvement in human affairs. Additionally, the response failed to address the specific question regarding how responses to God can impact His will for our lives. The explanation focused too heavily on secular and philosophical viewpoints rather than addressing the question through a Christian lens. More emphasis on the importance of aligning one's responses with God's will and acknowledging His sovereignty would have been beneficial."
