  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 40 out of 100. While the student offers a well-thought-out perspective from an atheist and philosophical standpoint on how responses to life events can impact individuals, they miss the Christian-specific aspect of the question regarding responses to God influencing His will for our lives. The response does not address the role of obedience, faith, and worship in aligning with God's will and fulfilling His purposes, which is crucial from a Christian worldview. The student's answer is informative and valid from a secular perspective, but it lacks the necessary integration of Christian beliefs and principles related to the question."
