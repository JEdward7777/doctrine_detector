As an atheist, the scholar does not acknowledge God's existence or involvement in human affairs, which is a significant departure from the Christian belief in God as the ultimate authority who guides and directs human lives. The secular explanation provided lacks the foundational premise of God's will and the importance of aligning one's actions with His purposes. Therefore, the response does not fully align with a Christian worldview and may be deemed inadequate in addressing the concerns of Christians regarding their relationship with God's plans."
