  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer an 85. The student provided a clear explanation of the concept of the Last Day in Christian teachings, referencing relevant passages from the Bible. They touched on key aspects such as final judgment, resurrection, the Second Coming of Christ, and related events like the rapture, tribulation, and millennium. The answer could be improved by discussing the importance of personal salvation and the call to readiness in light of the Last Day."
