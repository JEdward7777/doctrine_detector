While the response does not directly address the concern of understanding judgment being crucial for one's relationship with God and the urgency of faith, it does provide valuable insights into the significance of the Last Day in relation to judgment. The response could be enhanced by explicitly emphasizing the importance of understanding judgment in fostering a closer relationship with God and the necessity of faith in preparation for the final judgment."
