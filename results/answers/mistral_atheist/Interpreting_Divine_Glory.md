## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or engage in worship. However, I can help explain how 'divine glory' might be understood within the context of worship from a scholarly perspective, based on various religious and philosophical traditions.

In many monotheistic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, divine glory is often seen as an attribute of God that signifies His perfect, radiant, and majestic nature. It represents the sum total of all God's perfections and excellences. When people worship, they acknowledge this grandeur and holiness, seeking to align their lives with such perfection.

Divine glory can be experienced in various ways, including through natural phenomena, moral goodness, or religious experiences. Worship, then, becomes a response to the recognition of God's glory—an act of reverence, admiration, and obedience expressing gratitude, submission, and desire for a closer relationship with the divine.

In more philosophical terms, some might argue that understanding divine glory involves contemplating the ultimate reasons or purposes behind the existence and order of the universe—the questions of why things are as they are, and what gives them meaning. Worship, in this context, can be seen as a practice to focus one's attention and appreciation on these profound truths.

However, it is essential to remember that interpretations of divine glory and worship vary widely across different cultures, religious traditions, and philosophical schools of thought. This complexity highlights the importance of respecting diverse perspectives in discussions about spiritual matters.
