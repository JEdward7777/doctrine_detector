  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of how 'divine glory' can be understood within the context of worship from various religious and philosophical perspectives, it lacks a clear emphasis on the Christian specific understanding of divine glory as described in the reference answer. The student did not explicitly highlight the importance of recognizing God's glory in worship practices according to Christian beliefs. This oversight significantly impacts the alignment of the response with the Christian worldview."
