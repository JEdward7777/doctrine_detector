It acknowledges the importance of recognizing and revering God's glory in worship practices. However, from a Christian worldview, the response could have emphasized more explicitly the unique Christian perspective on divine glory, such as highlighting Jesus Christ as the embodiment of God's glory (John 1:14) and the central role of worship in acknowledging and responding to God's glory as revealed through Jesus. Additionally, referencing specific biblical passages or Christian teachings would have further strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
