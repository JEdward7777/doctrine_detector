It acknowledges the importance of recognizing God's glory in worship practices and how it influences expressions of reverence and awe. The integration of a Christian worldview perspective would enhance the response further, emphasizing Jesus Christ as the embodiment of divine glory and the centrality of His redemptive work in understanding and approaching God's magnificent nature in worship."
