  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of possible interpretations of Jesus' statement, showing a good understanding of the significance behind the words. However, the focus was more on personal interpretations rather than directly addressing the teacher's reference answer, which clearly states that Jesus is the source of resurrection and the one who causes people to come back to life. The student's response could have been improved by explicitly connecting their analysis to this specific Christian perspective."
