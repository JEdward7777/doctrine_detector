They provide multiple possible interpretations of the phrase, highlighting its connection to eternal life, the resurrection of Jesus himself, and spiritual transformation. The answer is well-reasoned and supported by relevant scriptures. However, it could benefit from a more explicit statement acknowledging Jesus' divine nature as the ultimate source of resurrection and life."
