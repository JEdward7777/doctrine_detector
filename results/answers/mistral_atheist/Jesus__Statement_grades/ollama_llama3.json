  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response attempts to clarify Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, but it falls short of fully engaging with the concern. While the student acknowledges that Jesus is the source of resurrection, they do not provide sufficient theological context or depth to support this claim. Additionally, the response does not explore the various possible meanings and implications of Jesus' statement, which is a crucial aspect of understanding his identity and role in resurrection.\n\nThe student's answer is overly simplistic and lacks nuance, failing to consider the complexities and richness of Jesus' statement. Furthermore, the response does not engage with the broader theological significance of Jesus' claim or its relevance to faith and Christian practice.\n\nTo improve, the student could have provided more theological insight and analysis, exploring the scriptural context and the various ways in which Jesus' statement has been understood throughout Christian history."
