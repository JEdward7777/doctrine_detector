However, while the response highlights different perspectives, it lacks a clear emphasis on Jesus as the ultimate source of resurrection and life, as stated in the given answer. The response could have further emphasized the significance of Jesus' identity as the Son of God and the importance of recognizing Him as the central figure in the process of resurrection for believers."
