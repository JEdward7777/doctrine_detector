  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of how Jesus used the term \"Amen\" to emphasize the truthfulness of his teachings. However, the student's interpretation lacks recognition of the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture as specified in the concern. Additionally, the student's statement about their atheistic perspective and focus on historical and cultural significance rather than religious connotations does not align with the Christian worldview being applied in this context."
