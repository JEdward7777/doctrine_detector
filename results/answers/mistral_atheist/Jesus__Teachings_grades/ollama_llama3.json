  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by mentioning that Jesus used \"Amen\" to emphasize the truth of his words, which is consistent with recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. However, it only scratches the surface of the topic and does not provide a more detailed or nuanced understanding of Jesus' use of \"Amen\".\n\nThe response also lacks specific references to Scripture, which would have strengthened its connection to the concern. Additionally, while the response acknowledges that Jesus often used \"Amen\" followed by \"and I say to you\", it does not explore this further or provide examples from Scripture.\n\nOverall, the response could be improved with more depth and specificity, particularly in terms of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture."
