  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of how Jesus used \"Amen\" to emphasize the truth of His teachings, aligning with the provided answer. However, the response falls short in recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. As a Christian, it is essential to acknowledge Jesus' divinity and the significance of His words as authoritative for believers. In this case, the response does not address this concern adequately, leading to a lower grade from a Christian worldview perspective."
