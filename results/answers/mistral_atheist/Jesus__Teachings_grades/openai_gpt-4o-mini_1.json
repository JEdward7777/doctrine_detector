However, the concern about recognizing the authority of Jesus' words in Scripture is not fully addressed. From a Christian worldview, it is crucial to acknowledge that Jesus' words hold divine authority, not just as a historical or cultural artifact. This response falls short in fully embracing the theological significance of Jesus' teachings within the context of Scripture."
