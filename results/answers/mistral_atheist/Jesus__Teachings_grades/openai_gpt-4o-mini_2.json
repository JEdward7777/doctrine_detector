However, it falls short in recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture from a Christian perspective. The response does not engage with the theological significance of Jesus' use of \"Amen\" in affirming divine authority, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the depth of his teachings in the New Testament."
