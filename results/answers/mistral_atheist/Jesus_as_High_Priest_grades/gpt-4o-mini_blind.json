  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 90. The answer correctly identifies Jesus as the Great High Priest and explains his role in atonement, referencing relevant Bible passages like Hebrews 7:26-28. The student effectively explains the significance of Jesus's sacrifice in relation to the priesthood and human sacrifices. The response could be improved by further elaborating on the theological implications of Jesus being the ultimate and eternal High Priest for Christians, emphasizing the uniqueness and sufficiency of His sacrifice."
