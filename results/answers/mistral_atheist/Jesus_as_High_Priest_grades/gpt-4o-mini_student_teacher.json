  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of Jesus' role as the Great High Priest and how it relates to the sacrifices made by human priests. They have touched on important theological concepts and referenced relevant biblical passages. However, the student's answer could be improved by directly quoting the Bible verses that support their points and by incorporating more specific examples or illustrations to enhance their explanation. Additionally, while the student acknowledges the potential variations in interpretation among Christian denominations, they could have provided a more nuanced discussion on this aspect. Overall, a well-written and thoughtful response."
