## Question [Jesus as High Priest](../../../questions/Jesus_as_High_Priest.md)
How is Jesus referred to in relation to the priesthood, and what does this mean for the sacrifices made by human priests?

## Correct Answer
Jesus is referred to as our 'great high priest' who intercedes for us in God's presence and offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, meaning that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer needed.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood

## [Answer](../Jesus_as_High_Priest.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian theology, Jesus is often referred to as the High Priest of a higher order or the Great High Priest. This title comes from his role as the mediator between God (the Holy) and humanity in the New Covenant.

In the Old Testament, the Levitical priesthood was responsible for performing sacrifices on behalf of the people to atone for their sins and maintain a relationship with God. These sacrifices were a ritual enactment of repentance and faith.

With Jesus as the Great High Priest, however, the need for such animal sacrifices is no longer necessary. According to Christian belief, Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection serve as the ultimate sacrifice that atones for the sins of humanity once and for all. This concept is often expressed in passages like Hebrews 7:26-28, where Jesus is described as "holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens," and whose sacrifice "perfects forever those who are being sanctified."

This shift from human priests making sacrifices to Jesus as the eternal High Priest signifies a change in the nature of atonement and the relationship between God and humanity. It's important to note that interpretations can vary among different Christian denominations and traditions, so it's essential to consider the specific beliefs and teachings of the particular group being studied.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response does an excellent job of highlighting Jesus' role as the Great High Priest, explaining how he intercedes for us in God's presence and offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin. This accurately addresses the concern of understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood.

However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:

1. While the response mentions that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer needed, it would be helpful to provide more context and explanation about how this shift relates to the New Covenant and the nature of atonement.
2. The response does not explicitly connect Jesus' role as High Priest to his mediatorial role between God and humanity, which is a crucial aspect of Christian theology.

Overall, while the response provides a good foundation for understanding Jesus' role in the priesthood, it could be strengthened with more depth and nuance.
