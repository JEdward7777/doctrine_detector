## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the New Testament, Jesus is often portrayed as a high priest in a spiritual sense, not in the traditional Jewish context of the High Priesthood. This is based on two main themes: His sacrificial role and His intercessory role.

1. Sacrificial Role: Jesus is described as the "Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). This reference to a lamb, an animal often sacrificed in the Jewish Temple, symbolizes Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity. He fulfills the role traditionally associated with the High Priest, offering a sacrifice on behalf of the people.

2. Intercessory Role: As our "Great High Priest" (Hebrews 4:14), Jesus intercedes for us before God. This is a continuous role, unlike the annual change of High Priests in the Jewish system. Jesus' intercession is permanent because He lives forever.

It's important to note that these are religious and symbolic interpretations rather than historical or political ones, as Jesus did not hold the title of High Priest in a literal sense during His life.
