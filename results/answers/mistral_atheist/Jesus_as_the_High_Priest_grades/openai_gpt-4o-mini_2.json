It provides a comprehensive explanation grounded in the Christian worldview, emphasizing the significance of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity and highlighting his continuous intercessory role as the Great High Priest. The response could be strengthened by including additional scriptural references or further elaborating on how these roles connect with Christian beliefs about salvation and redemption."
