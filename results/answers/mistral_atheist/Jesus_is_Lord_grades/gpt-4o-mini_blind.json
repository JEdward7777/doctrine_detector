  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The student provided a thoughtful response by emphasizing the need to clarify the spiritual significance of \"Jesus is Lord\" in a context where political leaders are also called 'Lord.' The explanation of Jesus as a spiritual leader and savior is accurate and appropriate. However, the response could be strengthened by explicitly stating the unique and exclusive lordship of Jesus Christ over all aspects of life, including politics. Additionally, the student could have further emphasized the biblical foundation of Jesus' lordship and the implications for believers in a potentially conflicting societal context."
