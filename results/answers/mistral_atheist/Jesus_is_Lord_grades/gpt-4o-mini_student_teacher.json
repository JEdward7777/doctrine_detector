  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 70.\n\nWhile the student correctly acknowledges the need for clarity in differentiating between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles, the suggested approach of using phrases like \"Jesus as Lord\" or \"The divine nature of Jesus\" could potentially dilute the specific theological significance of the term \"Lord\" as it pertains to Jesus. The student's response could more explicitly emphasize the unique and supreme authority of Jesus over all creation, distinct from human rulers, as the reference answer from the teacher does. The student does offer some valuable insights and considerations, such as historical and cultural context, which could enhance understanding, but the focus on clarifying the spiritual aspect could be stronger. Overall, the answer demonstrates understanding but could refine the theological depth of the explanation."
