  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 90.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern about differentiating Jesus' divine lordship from earthly titles, emphasizing that \"Jesus is Lord\" signifies His divine authority and supremacy over all creation. The provided examples and historical context also help to clarify any potential misunderstandings and foster a more informed and respectful dialogue about beliefs and values.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to explicitly state the spiritual nature of Jesus' lordship, as mentioned in the original concern. While the response implies this through its use of phrases like \"divine authority\" and \"supremacy over all creation,\" it could be further emphasized to fully address the concern. Nevertheless, overall, the response provides a clear and concise explanation that effectively addresses the concern about differentiating Jesus' divine lordship from earthly titles."
