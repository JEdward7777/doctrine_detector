However, the answer falls short doctrinally as it compromises on the core Christian belief of Jesus being the literal Son of God. In a Christian worldview, the deity of Jesus as the Son of God is non-negotiable. The emphasis should be on conveying the truth of Jesus' divinity within the context of Islamic beliefs rather than diluting or altering the fundamental Christian doctrine."
