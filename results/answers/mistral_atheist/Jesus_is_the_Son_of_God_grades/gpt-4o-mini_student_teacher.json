  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 70.\n\nWhile the student appropriately acknowledges and respects the differences in Christian and Islamic theology, and seeks to find a common ground, the suggested translation strays from maintaining the original terminology of \"Jesus is the Son of God.\" In a Christian context, it is crucial to uphold the biblical accuracy and significance of this statement. The answer falls short in directly addressing the original text and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning, as recommended by the teacher's reference answer. The student's response demonstrates inclusivity and sensitivity, but it compromises the essential doctrinal truth."
