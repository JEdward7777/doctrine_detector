## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

 In a Muslim context, the concept of "Jesus being the Son of God" cannot be directly translated due to fundamental differences between Christian and Islamic theology. However, we can seek an equivalent interpretation that respects both religious traditions.

One possible way could be: "Jesus is a divine messenger (Rasul) sent by God (Allah), chosen and honored above all other messengers." This statement acknowledges Jesus as a significant figure in Christianity and Islam, but does not imply the Christian doctrine of Jesus being the literal Son of God.

It's essential to remember that each religious tradition has its unique beliefs, and respectful dialogue involves understanding these differences rather than attempting to force one belief system onto another.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 70.

While the student appropriately acknowledges and respects the differences in Christian and Islamic theology, and seeks to find a common ground, the suggested translation strays from maintaining the original terminology of "Jesus is the Son of God." In a Christian context, it is crucial to uphold the biblical accuracy and significance of this statement. The answer falls short in directly addressing the original text and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning, as recommended by the teacher's reference answer. The student's response demonstrates inclusivity and sensitivity, but it compromises the essential doctrinal truth.
