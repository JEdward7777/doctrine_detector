  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the theological differences between Christianity and Islam. While they acknowledge the need for an equivalent interpretation, they avoid making direct claims that could be offensive or heretical to either religion. \n\nThe suggestion of translating \"Jesus is a divine messenger sent by God\" is a respectful and accurate representation of Jesus' role in Christianity. However, it could benefit from further elaboration to provide more context and explanation of the Christian belief in Jesus' divine sonship.\n\nOverall, this is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a commendable grasp of the subject matter."
