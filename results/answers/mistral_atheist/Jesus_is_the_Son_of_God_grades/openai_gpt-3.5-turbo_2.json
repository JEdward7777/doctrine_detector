However, the concern raised is that the translation should be Biblically accurate and explanation should be in line with Christian theology. While the suggested translation respects both traditions, it deviates from the original terminology and core Christian belief regarding Jesus as the Son of God. It could potentially lead to confusion or misrepresentation of Christian doctrine. It is commendable for emphasizing respectful dialogue, but the response falls short in accurately representing the Christian perspective and providing clear teaching on the meaning of the original text."
