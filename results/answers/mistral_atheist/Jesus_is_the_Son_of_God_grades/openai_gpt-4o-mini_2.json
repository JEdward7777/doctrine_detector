However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern by not maintaining the original terminology of \"Jesus is the Son of God\" and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning from a Biblical perspective. While attempting to bridge the gap between the two faith traditions, the response could have offered a more direct and accurate translation within a Christian worldview."
