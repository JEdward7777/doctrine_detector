The inclusion of these different dimensions enriches the understanding of the topic and demonstrates a deep engagement with the question. However, the student could have tied their points more directly to the central idea of Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the Messiah in the lineage of Abraham and David, as emphasized in the reference answer."
