The student demonstrated a good understanding of the biblical teachings on judgment and presented them effectively in relation to approaching relationships in a Christ-like manner. The answer could have been further enhanced by directly emphasizing the importance of supporting and encouraging one another's growth in faith, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
