## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 According to traditional Christian theology, as presented primarily in the New Testament of the Bible, the "Day of Judgment" (also known as the Last Judgment) is a future event when God will judge all humanity and determine their eternal destiny. This belief is based on passages from the New Testament, such as Matthew 25:31-46, where Jesus describes a scene where "all the nations" will be gathered before him and he will separate people into two groups: those who are worthy of entering the Kingdom of Heaven and those who are condemned to eternal punishment.

In this scenario, individuals are judged based on their adherence to God's commandments and their treatment of others, particularly the poor, sick, and needy. The parable of the Sheep and the Goats (Matthew 25:31-46) is often used as a guide to this concept. Those who have shown love, compassion, and service towards others will be welcomed into Heaven, while those who have neglected these duties will be condemned.

It's important to note that the interpretation of biblical texts can vary greatly among different Christian denominations and scholars. This is a very simplified overview and doesn't account for the rich and complex history of interpretations and nuances in Christian theology. I would encourage anyone interested in this topic to consult religious scholars or literature for a more detailed understanding.
