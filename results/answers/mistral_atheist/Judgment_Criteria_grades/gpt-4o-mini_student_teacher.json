  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of how individuals will be judged on the day of judgment according to the biblical perspective. They accurately reference key biblical passages and emphasize the importance of adherence to God's commandments and treatment of others. The student's response aligns well with the Christian worldview and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. The slight deduction in points is due to the student not directly addressing the concern regarding the alignment with biblical principles in their answer."
