## [Answer](../Judgment_and_Resurrection.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The concept of the 'Day of Yahweh' or 'Day of the Lord' is rooted in the religious traditions of ancient Israel and Judaism, as well as early Christianity. This day is not a fixed calendar date but refers to an eschatological event signifying divine judgment and salvation.

In Old Testament texts, the 'Day of Yahweh' often depicts a cataclysmic event where Yahweh intervenes in human history to establish his kingdom and bring justice upon the earth. This day is associated with several events such as:

1. The exodus from Egypt (Exodus 12, Isaiah 63:9-14) - God's deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery is seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate Day of Yahweh.
2. The fall of Jerusalem to Babylon in 587 BC (Jeremiah 4, Joel 1-2) - This event was interpreted by some prophets as a partial fulfillment of the 'Day of Yahweh.'
3. The final judgment and restoration at the end of time (Isaiah 2:12-22, Malachi 4:5-6) - This is the most common eschatological interpretation where the Day of Yahweh signifies God's final intervention in human history to bring about a new age of peace and justice.

In New Testament texts, the 'Day of the Lord' often refers to Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of Yahweh, with his life, death, and resurrection representing aspects of this eschatological event (2 Peter 3:3-10, Revelation 16:14-17). The second coming of Jesus Christ is also considered a part of the 'Day of the Lord.'
