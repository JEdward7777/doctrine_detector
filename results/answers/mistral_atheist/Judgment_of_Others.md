## Question [Judgment of Others](../../questions/Judgment_of_Others.md)
What does Jesus teach us about pointing out the faults of others in relation to our own faults?

## Target answer from notes
Jesus teaches us to first remove the plank from our own eye before pointing out the speck in someone else's eye, reminding us to practice humility and self-reflection (Luke 6:41-42).

## Concern to grade by
Criticizing others while ignoring our own faults can reflect hypocrisy and diminish our witness as Christians.

## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or attitudes. However, I can provide information based on various religious and philosophical texts. In the case of Jesus' teachings, as presented in the New Testament of the Bible, there are several passages that address the issue you mentioned.

One notable passage is Matthew 7:1-5 (King James Version):

"Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye."

This passage emphasizes self-reflection and humility when judging others. It suggests that one should focus on their own faults before pointing out the faults of others, thereby encouraging empathy, understanding, and forgiveness in interpersonal relationships. This teaching is often interpreted as a call to avoid hypocrisy and to strive for moral integrity oneself before trying to correct others.
