  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately presents the teaching from Matthew 7:1-5 regarding judging others and the emphasis on self-reflection before pointing out faults in others. The explanation of the passage aligns well with Christian teachings on humility, empathy, understanding, and avoiding hypocrisy. It could have been strengthened by further connecting the teaching to the overall message of Jesus on love, forgiveness, and personal transformation."
