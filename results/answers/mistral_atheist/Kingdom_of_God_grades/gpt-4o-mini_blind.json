The student correctly acknowledges the importance of maintaining the original meaning while adapting it to the target culture. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it is essential to emphasize that the \"Kingdom of God\" is a unique and specific theological concept in Christianity, representing God's reign and rule over all creation rather than just a community or family of believers. The student could enhance their answer by stressing the doctrinal significance of the term within Christian theology."
