  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided thoughtful insights and strategies for cross-cultural translation, the concern was to evaluate the advisability of rephrasing 'Kingdom of God'. The reference answer specifically advised against rephrasing and emphasized retaining the term with explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance. The student's answer did not directly address this concern and instead focused on strategies for adaptation. Therefore, a score of 60 is given for providing relevant information but not directly aligning with the specific concern provided."
