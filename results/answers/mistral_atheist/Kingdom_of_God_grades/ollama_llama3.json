  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response acknowledges the concern about losing the depth and biblical context of the term \"Kingdom of God\" by suggesting strategies for rephrasing or adapting the phrase to different cultural contexts. However, it does not directly address the concern that the original phrase should be retained with explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance.\n\nWhile the response provides some good ideas for how to handle cross-cultural translation and interpretation, it does not specifically argue for retaining the original phrase \"Kingdom of God\" as requested in the answer. Instead, it presents alternatives such as contextualization, cultural adaptation, translation by analogy, and multiple translations.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have directly addressed the concern about losing depth and biblical context while still providing some creative solutions for rephrasing or adapting the phrase to different cultures."
