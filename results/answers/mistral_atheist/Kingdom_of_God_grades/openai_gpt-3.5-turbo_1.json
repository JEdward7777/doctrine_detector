However, it does not fully align with a Christian worldview that values preserving the original meaning and significance of biblical terms. While the strategies provided in the original response are valid in a cross-cultural context, from a Christian perspective, it is essential to prioritize retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' and providing explanations that emphasize its spiritual and eschatological significance. Thus, the response could have been strengthened by emphasizing the importance of maintaining the biblical integrity of the term while still engaging with cross-cultural challenges."
