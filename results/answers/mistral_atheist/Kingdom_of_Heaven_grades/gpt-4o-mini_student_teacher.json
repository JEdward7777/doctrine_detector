  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive analysis of why retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"Kingdom of Heaven\" is important, considering historical, theological, cultural sensitivity, and consistency reasons. However, the student's answer focuses more on the general significance and broader understanding of the term \"heaven\" in the biblical context rather than specifically addressing the distinctiveness of Matthew's gospel and the theological implications related to God's reign, as highlighted in the reference answer. Further emphasis on Matthew's unique usage and theological nuances specific to his gospel would have enhanced the response."
