  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"Kingdom of Heaven\". The author provides four compelling reasons for why this term is important, including historical context, theological significance, cultural sensitivity, and continuity and consistency. These reasons are well-supported by biblical scholarship and demonstrate a deep respect for the original language and culture.\n\nThe only area where the response falls short is in its focus on the distinctiveness of Matthew's gospel. While the response does acknowledge that retaining \"heaven\" is significant because it is distinctive to Matthew's gospel, this point is not fully developed or integrated into the overall argument. The response would be even stronger if it explored how the use of \"heaven\" in Matthew contributes to a deeper understanding of Jesus' teachings and the Christian faith.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that demonstrates a clear and thoughtful engagement with the concern about understanding the unique terminology used in the gospels."
