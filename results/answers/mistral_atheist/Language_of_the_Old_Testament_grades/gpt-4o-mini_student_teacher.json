They also demonstrated understanding of the historical context and acknowledged the presence of Aramaic in certain portions. The additional details about scholarly consensus and the significance of the Hebrew language in ancient Israel added depth to their answer. Overall, an excellent response with minor details exceeding the reference answer."
