  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response is largely accurate, acknowledging that the majority of the Old Testament was written in Biblical Hebrew (Classical Hebrew). It also correctly notes that some portions were written in Aramaic, specifically in Daniel and Jeremiah. The acknowledgment of scholarly consensus adds credibility to the answer.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response could be more detailed and explicit in its statement. The original answer, \"The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew,\" is somewhat vague and could be misleading if taken at face value. A more precise statement would have been helpful.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the linguistic context of the Old Testament and its importance for studying the Scriptures. With some additional detail and clarification, it could be even stronger."
