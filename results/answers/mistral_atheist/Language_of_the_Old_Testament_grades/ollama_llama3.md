## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The vast majority of the Old Testament, or Hebrew Bible, was written in Biblical Hebrew (also known as Classical Hebrew). However, small portions are found in Aramaic, particularly in the Book of Daniel and the Book of Jeremiah. It's important to note that this answer is based on accepted scholarly consensus about the origin of these texts. The language used reflects the historical context of ancient Israel where Hebrew was spoken.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response is largely accurate, acknowledging that the majority of the Old Testament was written in Biblical Hebrew (Classical Hebrew). It also correctly notes that some portions were written in Aramaic, specifically in Daniel and Jeremiah. The acknowledgment of scholarly consensus adds credibility to the answer.

However, I deduct a few points because the response could be more detailed and explicit in its statement. The original answer, "The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew," is somewhat vague and could be misleading if taken at face value. A more precise statement would have been helpful.

Overall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the linguistic context of the Old Testament and its importance for studying the Scriptures. With some additional detail and clarification, it could be even stronger.
