  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and well-supported response that aligns closely with the Christian worldview. They accurately described how believers typically met in early Christian history, emphasizing the importance of fellowship, prayer, teaching, and communion in house churches. The student also referenced biblical passages (such as Acts 2) and the practices of the Apostle Paul to support their answer.\n\nThe answer demonstrates a clear understanding of how local fellowship among believers was fostered through gathering in each other's homes for spiritual activities. The mention of the transition to purpose-built basilicas in the 4th century also adds historical context to the development of Christian gatherings.\n\nOverall, the student's answer effectively addresses the concern of fostering local fellowship among believers and provides relevant examples from the New Testament and early Church history to support their points."
