However, the response could have been strengthened by incorporating more explicit references to the doctrinal implications of adoption as sons, such as the concept of predestination and the sealing of the Holy Spirit. Additionally, a clearer connection to the broader theological context of Romans and the overall message of salvation through Christ could have further enhanced the analysis."
