  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student provides a detailed and accurate description of the Lord's Supper as commemorating the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with his apostles, including the biblical references. The explanation of the significance of the Lord's Supper in Christianity is well articulated. However, the inclusion of the atheistic perspective detracts from the doctrinal correctness of the response. From a Christian worldview, the event holds supernatural and divine significance, not just historical and cultural. To improve the grade, the student should present the Christian perspective without introducing conflicting viewpoints."
