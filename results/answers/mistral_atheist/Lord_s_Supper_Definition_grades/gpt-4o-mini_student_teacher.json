  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student accurately described the events surrounding the establishment of the Lord's Supper and its significance in Christianity, their atheistic perspective undermines the true belief and meaning behind this practice. The student missed the Christian worldview that the Lord's Supper symbolizes Jesus' sacrifice for sin, which is a fundamental aspect of the faith. This perspective significantly detracts from the understanding of the Lord's Supper in Christian belief."
