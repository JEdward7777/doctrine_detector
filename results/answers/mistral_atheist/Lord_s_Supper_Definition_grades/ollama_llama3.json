However, it falls short in terms of understanding the meaning and significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian faith.\n\nWhile the response acknowledges Jesus' institution of the Lord's Supper as recorded in Luke 22:19-20, it fails to delve deeper into the theological implications and biblical symbolism behind this event. The concern specifically asks for an understanding of the Lord's Supper in Christian faith, which this response does not fully address.\n\nFurthermore, the addition of a non-Christian perspective (the \"atheistic scholar\") and the neutral description of the Lord's Supper as a \"significant ritual practice\" dilutes the theological focus and may create confusion about its true significance in Christian faith."
