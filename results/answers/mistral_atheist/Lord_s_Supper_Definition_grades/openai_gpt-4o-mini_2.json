As an atheistic scholar, there is a lack of understanding or acknowledgment of the core Christian belief that the Lord's Supper symbolizes the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ for the atonement of sins. From a Christian worldview, recognizing the spiritual aspect of the Lord's Supper is essential for a complete understanding of its meaning and significance in Christian faith."
