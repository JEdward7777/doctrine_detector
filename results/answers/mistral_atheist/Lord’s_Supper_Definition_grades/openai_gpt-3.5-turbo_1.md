# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The Lord's Supper, also known as Communion or Eucharist, is a religious practice in Christianity that is believed to commemorate the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with his apostles, as recorded in the New Testament. During this last meal before his crucifixion, Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper by taking bread, giving thanks, breaking it, and giving it to his disciples, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19). Similarly, he took the cup after supper, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20).

However, as an atheistic scholar, I don't hold a belief in the supernatural or divine origin of this event. From a historical and cultural perspective, the Lord's Supper represents a significant ritual practice within Christianity that has been passed down through tradition for over 2000 years, symbolizing unity, remembrance, and sacrifice among believers.

Grade: 20

Comment: While the response accurately depicts the historical events surrounding the institution of the Lord's Supper, it falls short in addressing the Christian belief in the supernatural and divine origin of this sacrament. As an atheistic scholar, the grading is low as it dismisses the core Christian belief regarding the Lord's Supper as a symbol of Jesus' sacrificial death for the redemption of humanity, missing the essence of its significance in Christian faith.
