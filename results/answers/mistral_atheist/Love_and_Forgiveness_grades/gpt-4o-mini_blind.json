The student effectively references relevant Old and New Testament passages to support their points and connects forgiveness to reflecting God's nature, restoring relationships, promoting peace, redemption, and acknowledging God's sovereignty. The explanation is thorough and aligns well with Christian teachings on forgiveness. Great job!"
