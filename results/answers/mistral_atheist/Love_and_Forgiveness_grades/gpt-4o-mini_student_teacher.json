They utilized relevant scripture, effectively highlighted key reasons for forgiveness, and connected it to reflecting God's nature and promoting love and reconciliation. However, the answer could have been more concise and directly addressed the concern by emphasizing God's unconditional love as the primary reason for forgiveness in daily interactions."
