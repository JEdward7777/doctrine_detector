## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The names of the twelve disciples are listed in three books of the New Testament of the Bible:

1. Matthew 10:2-4: Here, the names appear as follows: Simon (who is called Peter), Andrew his brother, James son of Zebedee, John his brother, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.

2. Mark 3:16-19: The order is slightly different: Andrew, Peter, James son of Zebedee, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James (son of Alphaeus), Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.

3. Luke 6:14-16: The order is similar to that in Matthew but without Thaddaeus: Simon (who is called Peter), Andrew his brother, James son of Zebedee, John his brother, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.

It is interesting to note that each list has slightly different orderings but contains the same twelve disciples. The differences may be due to variations in manuscripts or the way the lists were compiled.

Comment: This response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of where the names of the twelve disciples can be found in the Bible, along with noting the variations in the order of the lists. The inclusion of relevant Bible references adds depth to the answer. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning the Book of Acts, where the replacement of Judas Iscariot by Matthias is also documented. Great job overall!
