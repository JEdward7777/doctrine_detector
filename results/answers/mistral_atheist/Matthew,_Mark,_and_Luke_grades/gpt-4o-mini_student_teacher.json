  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate response, demonstrating a deep understanding of the question and citing specific verses where the names of the twelve disciples are listed in the Gospel accounts. However, the student's answer went beyond the scope of the question by discussing the variations in the order of the disciples' names. While this additional information is interesting, the concern was to demonstrate familiarity with the Gospel accounts and their teachings, which the student did effectively."
