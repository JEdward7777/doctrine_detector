  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately states that the names of the twelve disciples are listed in three books of the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), which matches the correct answer. Additionally, it provides specific examples from each book to demonstrate the slight variations in ordering between Matthew and Luke, as well as between Mark and the other two books.\n\nHowever, while the response does show some understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings, it could be improved by delving deeper into the significance or implications of these lists. For example, what do the similarities and differences in the lists reveal about the relationships among the disciples or Jesus' ministry? How do these lists relate to other passages in the Gospels that describe the disciples' roles and interactions with Jesus?\n\nOverall, while the response is informative and accurate, it could benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings."
