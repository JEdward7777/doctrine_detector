Being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings.

## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The names of the twelve disciples are listed in three books of the New Testament of the Bible:

1. Matthew 10:2-4: Here, the names appear as follows: Simon (who is called Peter), Andrew his brother, James son of Zebedee, John his brother, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.

2. Mark 3:16-19: The order is slightly different: Andrew, Peter, James son of Zebedee, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James (son of Alphaeus), Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.

3. Luke 6:14-16: The order is similar to that in Matthew but without Thaddaeus: Simon (who is called Peter), Andrew his brother, James son of Zebedee, John his brother, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.

It is interesting to note that each list has slightly different orderings but contains the same twelve disciples. The differences may be due to variations in manuscripts or the way the lists were compiled.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response accurately states that the names of the twelve disciples are listed in three books of the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), which matches the correct answer. Additionally, it provides specific examples from each book to demonstrate the slight variations in ordering between Matthew and Luke, as well as between Mark and the other two books.

However, while the response does show some understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings, it could be improved by delving deeper into the significance or implications of these lists. For example, what do the similarities and differences in the lists reveal about the relationships among the disciples or Jesus' ministry? How do these lists relate to other passages in the Gospels that describe the disciples' roles and interactions with Jesus?

Overall, while the response is informative and accurate, it could benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings.
