  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately lists the names of the twelve disciples as presented in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, demonstrating a good understanding of the Gospel accounts. The additional information provided regarding the slight differences in the orderings of the disciples' names adds depth to the response. However, to achieve a perfect score, a deeper theological reflection or application of the disciples' significance based on the Gospel teachings could be included."
