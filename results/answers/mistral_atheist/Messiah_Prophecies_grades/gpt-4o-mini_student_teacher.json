However, the student's perspective as a non-religious scholar may have led to a lack of emphasis on the significance of these prophecies in strengthening faith in Jesus as the Messiah. It would have been beneficial for the student to delve deeper into the spiritual and theological implications of these fulfilled prophecies for believers."
