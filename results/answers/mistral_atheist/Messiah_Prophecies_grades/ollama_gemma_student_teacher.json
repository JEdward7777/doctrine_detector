They provide specific examples of prophecies and their alleged fulfillment by Jesus, supporting their claims with relevant textual references. However, the absence of any theological or religious background limits the depth of their analysis. The student's neutral stance and acknowledgment of differing interpretations enhance the objectivity of their response."
