## [Answer](../Messianic_Identity.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The title "King of the Jews" holds significant religious and political connotations within the context of ancient Judaism, particularly during the time of Jesus. It is important to understand that the concept of a Messiah in Judaism was multifaceted, encompassing both spiritual and political aspects.

The title "King of the Jews" was primarily a political one, as it implied ruling over an independent Jewish state, which had been lost for centuries. The Messianic expectation included a deliverer who would restore Israel to its former glory and establish peace and prosperity. This political dimension is reflected in prophecies such as those found in Isaiah 9:6-7, where the Messiah is described as a "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."

However, Jesus' identity as the Messiah was not primarily understood in political terms by his followers. Instead, they saw him as fulfilling the spiritual aspect of the messianic expectation - bringing salvation and redemption to humanity through his teachings, sacrifice, and resurrection. The Gospel accounts portray Jesus as referring to himself as the Son of Man, a figure from Jewish apocalyptic literature who was associated with divine judgment and the establishment of God's kingdom.

In the broader context of Jesus' time, the Romans were the rulers of Judea, and any claim to be a "King of the Jews" would have been perceived as a political threat by the Roman authorities. This may have contributed to Jesus' crucifixion, as he was seen as a potential rebel leader challenging Roman rule.

So, while the title "King of the Jews" held significant political implications for Jesus during his lifetime, its significance in relation to his identity as the Messiah is more spiritual and theological - a deliverer who brings salvation and establishes God's kingdom spiritually rather than politically.
