However, the answer falls short of explicitly connecting the title to Jesus' role as the promised Messiah, descended from King David and with an eternal reign, which is central to understanding Jesus' messianic role in the Christian faith. A stronger emphasis on this specific aspect would have enhanced the answer, aligning it more closely with a Christian worldview perspective."
