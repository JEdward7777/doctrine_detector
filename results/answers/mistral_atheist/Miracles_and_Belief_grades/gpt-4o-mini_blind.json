However, the answer falls short in emphasizing the foundational aspect of miracles as manifestations of God's power and purpose rather than just being events outside of natural explanations. The critique mentioned regarding circular reasoning could have been addressed more effectively by highlighting that miracles are not just evidence of God's existence but are signs of His presence and intervention in the world. Additionally, the answer could have benefited from a clearer assertion of the biblical understanding of miracles as signs and wonders that point to God's glory and truth."
