  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated explanation on the concept of miracles within religious beliefs, addressing the argument from miracles and potential criticisms effectively. However, the answer lacked a direct connection to how miracles function as signs leading to belief in God, as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. To enhance the grade, the student could have focused more on the transformative aspect of miracles in sparking belief and illustrating God's power in a way that draws individuals closer to faith."
