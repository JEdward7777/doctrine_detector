It acknowledges the significance of miracles in validating faith and the ministry of prophets and apostles. However, the response could further emphasize the transformative power of miracles in leading others to faith, aligning more closely with the concern provided. Overall, a well-analyzed and reasoned response from a Christian worldview."
