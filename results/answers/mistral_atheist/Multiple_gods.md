## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or engage in missionary work. However, I can help provide a response to this common misconception about Christianity.

The Christian belief is monotheistic, which means they worship one God. This single deity is often referred to as the Trinity: God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The concept of the Trinity is not three separate gods, but one united God in three distinct persons. It's a fundamental tenet of Christian faith that has been developed through centuries of theological reflection.

It may be helpful for missionaries to emphasize this monotheistic aspect when discussing Christianity with others who might hold misconceptions about the number of gods Christians believe in. They could also provide resources, such as religious texts or scholarly works, that explain the Christian understanding of God in more detail. It's essential to foster open and respectful dialogue, recognizing that cultural perspectives can influence beliefs and misunderstandings may arise.
