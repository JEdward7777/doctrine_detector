## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or follow a particular religion. However, I can provide you with information about the historical and symbolic significance of myrrh in the context of the biblical story of Jesus' birth.

Myrrh is one of the three gifts given to Jesus by the Magi (or wise men) at his birth according to the New Testament of the Bible, along with gold and frankincense. Myrrh was a valuable aromatic resin used in ancient times for various purposes, including embalming, perfume-making, and medicinal applications.

In biblical times, myrrh was highly valued as an offering to God, and it had significant symbolic meaning. In the Old Testament, myrrh is mentioned as one of the ingredients in the holy anointing oil used for religious ceremonies (Exodus 30:23). Additionally, myrrh is used as part of the incense offerings described in several books of the Bible (e.g., Exodus 30:34-38; Isaiah 60:6).

In the New Testament, myrrh is associated with Jesus' crucifixion and burial, as it was one of the substances used to embalm his body (John 19:39-40). This may suggest that the Magi's gift of myrrh foreshadowed Jesus' sacrifice and the redemptive nature of his life.

Therefore, the gift of myrrh given to Jesus at his birth is significant not only as a valuable and exotic present but also as a symbol of religious devotion, sacrifice, and prophetic foreshadowing of Jesus' future role and eventual death.
