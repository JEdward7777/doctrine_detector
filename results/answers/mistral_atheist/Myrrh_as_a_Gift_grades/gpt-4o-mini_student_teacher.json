  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the symbolism of myrrh in the biblical context of Jesus' birth, connecting it to religious significance, sacrifice, and foreshadowing of Jesus' future. The student effectively linked myrrh to the crucifixion and burial of Jesus, emphasizing its prophetic nature. However, the student could have emphasized more clearly the specific aspect of myrrh representing Jesus' future suffering and death as the Messiah. Overall, a well-reasoned and informative response."
