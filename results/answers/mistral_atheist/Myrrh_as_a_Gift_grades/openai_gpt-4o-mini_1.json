  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively recognizes the symbolism of myrrh in the context of Jesus' birth, acknowledging its representation of Jesus' future suffering and sacrificial role as the Messiah. It demonstrates a good understanding of how understanding the symbolic meaning of the gifts can deepen appreciation of Jesus' purpose and mission. However, it could have connected this symbolism more explicitly to the concern provided, which would have enhanced the overall coherence of the response."
