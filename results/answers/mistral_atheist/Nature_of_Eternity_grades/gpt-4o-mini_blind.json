  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85/100\n\nComment: The student's response provides a generally accurate explanation of how eternity is defined in the context of Christian beliefs. They correctly mention the timeless and endless nature of eternity, its association with God, and the concept of eternal life in Heaven and Hell based on individual beliefs and actions. The acknowledgement of varying interpretations among Christian denominations adds depth to the explanation. However, to improve the grade, the student could have included more specific scriptural references to support their points and delve deeper into the theological implications of eternity in Christian doctrine."
