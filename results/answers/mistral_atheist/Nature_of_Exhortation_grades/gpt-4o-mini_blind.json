  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive and well-rounded understanding of how Christians should approach exhortation based on the teachings of the New Testament. The student correctly emphasizes the importance of love, humility, truth, grace, encouragement, consolation, patience, perseverance, and prayer in the process of exhortation. The references to relevant biblical passages support the points made. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly emphasize the importance of exhortation being grounded in the authority of Scripture and the ultimate goal of pointing others towards Christ and His teachings."
