  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer on how Christians should approach exhortation based on the teachings of the New Testament. However, there was an oversight in directly addressing the concern of ensuring that encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner, which is the primary focus of the reference answer. The response should have emphasized the importance of exhorting others in love rather than elaborating on various aspects of Christian exhortation. The student showed good knowledge and interpretation of the subject matter but missed the mark on the specific concern provided."
