## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or practices, but I can help clarify the statement made by Jesus about God being a spirit based on biblical texts and scholarly interpretations.

In John 4:24, Jesus is quoted as saying, "God is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth." In this context, the phrase "God is Spirit" emphasizes that God cannot be confined or represented by physical forms or objects. Instead, He is eternal, all-powerful, and infinite. This concept challenges people to move beyond relying on material symbols or idols for their understanding of God.

Regarding how this understanding should influence our worship, it suggests that authentic worship should come from an inner spiritual connection with God rather than focusing solely on external rituals or practices. Worship should be sincere and genuine, reflecting a deep personal relationship with the divine. Additionally, this teaching encourages people to seek truth in their religious beliefs, practices, and understanding of God.
