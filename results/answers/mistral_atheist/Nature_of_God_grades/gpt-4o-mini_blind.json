The emphasis on worshiping God in spirit and truth is well articulated, and the connection between God's spiritual nature and sincere worship is effectively conveyed. However, to enhance the response, adding more depth to the implications of God being a spirit in terms of Christian theology and how it shapes the believer's understanding of God's omnipresence and transcendence would further strengthen the answer."
