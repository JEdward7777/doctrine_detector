However, it did not clearly emphasize the severity and purpose of Hell as the final punishment for those who reject God, which is crucial in understanding the Christian view of judgment and salvation. Additionally, while highlighting various interpretations within Christian denominations, the response could have emphasized more on the ultimate consequence of Hell for those who do not accept Jesus' sacrifice."
