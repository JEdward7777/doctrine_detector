## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In a Christian context, as described in the Bible, "Judgment Day" (also known as the Last Judgment) refers to a future event when God will pass judgment on all human beings who have ever lived. This is based on teachings in various books of the New Testament, including Matthew 25:31-46, which states that Jesus Christ will separate the righteous (those who believed and followed Him) from the unrighteous (those who did not believe or followed Him). The righteous are said to inherit eternal life in heaven, while the unrighteous are sent to eternal punishment in hell. However, interpretations of these teachings can vary significantly among different Christian denominations and individual believers.
