It correctly references relevant scripture and the ultimate separation of the righteous and unrighteous. However, the mention of varying interpretations among different Christian denominations and believers could be expanded upon to emphasize the core Christian belief in the final judgment based on faith in Jesus Christ. Additionally, reinforcing the biblical basis of this event and the concept of accountability before God could strengthen the response further."
