## [Answer](../Nature_of_Manna.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 According to the Bible, the appearance of manna is described in Exodus 16:31 as being like "coriander seed, white; and the taste was like wafers made with honey." However, it's important to note that the manna described in the Bible is a miraculous food provided by God during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, and it may not have resembled actual coriander seeds or honey-flavored wafers as we understand them today. The descriptions are metaphorical and culturally contextualized within the ancient Near Eastern worldview.
