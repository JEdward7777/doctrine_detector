  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate answer to the question, demonstrating knowledge of the scriptural description of manna from Exodus 16:31 and the context of its miraculous provision by God. The student acknowledged the metaphorical and culturally contextual nature of the description, aligning well with a Christian worldview perspective on divine provision. The student's response accurately conveys the appearance and taste of manna as described in the Bible while also cautioning against overly literal interpretations. Great job overall."
