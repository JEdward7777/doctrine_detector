It effectively clarifies that Scripture encompasses the written messages considered God's Word, including the Old Testament, and that the term \"Word of God\" can refer not only to these writings but also to other messages from God, such as those delivered by Jesus. The reference to Jesus as the embodiment of God's Word is particularly insightful and aligns well with Christian beliefs. Overall, a strong understanding is demonstrated in addressing the concern."
