## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar without religious beliefs, I approach this question from a secular perspective. From this viewpoint, it's important to distinguish between the concept of "sin" as it is often used in religious contexts, and the more universal concepts of moral wrongdoing and human psychology.

Our sinful nature, or inherent tendency towards certain behaviors that are generally considered immoral or unethical, can be understood from a psychological standpoint as a product of our evolutionary history, social learning, and personal experiences. This "nature" can predispose individuals to certain actions, but it is not deterministic; free will and environmental factors play significant roles as well.

External influences, such as peer pressure, media, societal norms, and cultural expectations, also significantly impact our behavior and choices. These influences can shape our values, beliefs, and decisions, making us more or less likely to engage in certain behaviors. In some cases, external pressures may lead individuals to act against their personal ethical standards or moral compasses, contributing to temptation.

However, it's essential to note that the balance between internal and external factors can vary greatly among individuals, and no single explanation can fully capture the complexity of human behavior. Understanding both our innate predispositions and the role of external influences helps us develop more effective strategies for promoting ethical behavior and resisting temptation in a diverse and dynamic society.
