While the secular perspective on influences such as evolutionary history, social learning, and personal experiences is acknowledged, the crucial Christian understanding of the role of sin and external influences, including Satan, in leading individuals to sin is completely disregarded. Without acknowledging the spiritual dimension of temptation from a Christian worldview, the response falls short in addressing the concern presented."
