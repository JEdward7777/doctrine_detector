However, the Christian-specific concern of \"sinful nature\" and the role of Satan as an external influence in tempting individuals to sin are not adequately addressed. From a Christian worldview, the response lacks a recognition of the spiritual dimension of temptation and the concept of sin as disobedience to God. More emphasis on the spiritual aspects of temptation in line with Christian teachings would have strengthened the analysis."
