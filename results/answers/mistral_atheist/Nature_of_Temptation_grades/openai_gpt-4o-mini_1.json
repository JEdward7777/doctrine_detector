It lacks acknowledgment of the role of spiritual forces such as Satan in tempting individuals to sin. The secular perspective presented overlooks the foundational belief in Christianity that sin stems from both our inherent sinful nature and external spiritual influences. A more comprehensive understanding of Christian teachings on sin and temptation is needed to fully address the concerns raised."
