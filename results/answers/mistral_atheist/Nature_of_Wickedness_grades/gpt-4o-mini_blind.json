The explanation of the consequences of wickedness and the possibility of repentance and redemption is well articulated. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the gravity of the eternal consequences of wickedness and a clearer distinction between worldly consequences and eternal damnation. Additionally, a more direct reference to the need for repentance through faith in Jesus Christ as essential for salvation would have strengthened the theological completeness of the answer."
