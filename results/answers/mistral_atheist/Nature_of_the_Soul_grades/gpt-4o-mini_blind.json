The explanation is clear and covers important Biblical references. However, the response could be improved by delving deeper into specific biblical passages that illustrate the distinction between the soul and spirit more clearly. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the doctrinal significance of these concepts within Christian theology would have enhanced the overall depth of the answer."
