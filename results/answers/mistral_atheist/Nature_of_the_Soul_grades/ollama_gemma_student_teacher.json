  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical definitions of \"soul\" and \"spirit,\" highlighting their differences and overlaps. The student provides clear examples from scripture to support their claims. However, it would benefit from a more elaborate explanation of how the Bible's cultural and historical context influences the understanding of these terms. Additionally, the student's recognition of the varying contexts in which these terms appear adds nuance to their response."
