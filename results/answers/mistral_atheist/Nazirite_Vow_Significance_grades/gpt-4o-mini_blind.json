  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid overview of the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as outlined in Numbers 6:1-4. The student effectively explains each restriction and its significance in the context of the vow. However, to enhance the grade, the student could have elaborated more on the spiritual significance and symbolic meanings behind each restriction. Additionally, connecting these restrictions to broader theological themes within the Jewish faith could have enriched the response further. Overall, a well-done explanation with room for deeper theological exploration."
