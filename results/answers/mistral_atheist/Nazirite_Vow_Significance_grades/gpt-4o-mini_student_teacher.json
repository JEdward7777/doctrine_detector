  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80. The student accurately listed the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as described in Numbers 6:1-4. However, the answer included additional details beyond the specific restrictions mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and provided a thorough explanation of each restriction, showing knowledge of the biblical context and the significance of the Nazirite vow."
