  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the significance of Psalms in the Christian faith, referencing specific instances in the New Testament where Psalms are quoted or alluded to. They also discussed the use of Psalms in Christian worship and the varied interpretations within different denominations. However, the student did not directly address the specific instruction given in the New Testament regarding singing Psalms to God as a form of worship, which is the key point emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the relevance of Psalms in Christianity, but could have been improved by directly addressing the specific instruction given in the New Testament regarding singing Psalms."
