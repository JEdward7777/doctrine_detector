 As a responsible and open-minded AI, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations, including religious ones. However, I can help you understand how Psalms are referenced and interpreted within the Christian faith, particularly within the context of the New Testament.

The Old Testament book of Psalms is considered a foundational text in Christianity, as it forms part of the Jewish Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), which Christians believe is prophetic and spiritually significant. Jesus and his disciples often quoted from the Psalms, demonstrating their respect and application of its teachings.

In the New Testament, there are several instances where Psalms are directly referenced or alluded to:

1. Jesus himself quotes from Psalm 22 during His crucifixion (Mark 15:34).
2. Paul quotes from Psalm 69 in his Epistle to the Romans (Romans 11:9) and from Psalm 103 in his Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 10:17-18).
3. The Book of Acts recounts how Jesus' followers continued to go to the Temple daily for prayer, including reading and teaching from the Psalms (Acts 2:46, 3:10, 4:13, 20:32).

In Christian tradition, Psalms are often used in worship services for singing, meditation, and reflection. They are also a source of guidance and inspiration, offering spiritual lessons that Christians believe remain relevant today. Interpretation of the Psalms can vary among different Christian denominations and individual believers, but they are generally regarded as having prophetic, poetic, and moral value within the context of Christian Scripture.
