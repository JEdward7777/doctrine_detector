## [Answer](../New_Testament_Priesthood.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the New Testament, particularly in the Epistles of Paul, there is a concept that all believers in Jesus Christ are considered as members of a priesthood, not in the sense of having sacrificial duties or performing religious rituals, but rather in terms of spiritual service and ministry. This idea is rooted in the Old Testament where only the Levitical priests had direct access to God and performed the necessary sacrifices on behalf of the people. However, with the coming of Christ, the New Covenant abolished the need for such earthly intermediaries (Hebrews 7:12, 10:19-22).

Now, every believer has direct access to God through faith in Jesus and can offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to Him (1 Peter 2:5). This new priesthood is represented by the image of a spiritual temple built from living stones (1 Peter 2:4-5), where each stone or believer offers up spiritual sacrifices that are pleasing to God. These sacrifices can include acts of service, love, and obedience.

It's essential to note that this doesn't mean every Christian has the same role or responsibility within the church community. The New Testament also outlines specific roles for leaders and ministers within the body of believers (e.g., Ephesians 4:11-12). Nevertheless, all believers are priests in the sense that they have access to God through Christ and are called to serve Him and others.
