  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 85. The student demonstrated a solid understanding of the concept of the priesthood of all believers and effectively explained it using biblical references. They highlighted how believers now have direct access to God through Christ and can offer spiritual sacrifices. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the aspect of believers being able to intercede for themselves and others in prayer as priests. Additionally, a clearer connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher would have strengthened the student's response. Overall, a well-written and insightful answer."
