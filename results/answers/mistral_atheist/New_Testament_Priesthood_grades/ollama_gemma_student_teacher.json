  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of the priesthood of all believers and its significance in the New Testament. They accurately explain that the priesthood is not about performing sacrificial duties but rather about spiritual service and ministry. The student also highlights the abolition of the earthly priesthood in favor of direct access to God through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific ways believers can offer spiritual sacrifices and how this relates to their daily lives and actions."
