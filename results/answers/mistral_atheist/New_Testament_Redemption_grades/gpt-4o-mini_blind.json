The student effectively explains the shift from ritualistic purification in the Old Testament to a more spiritual understanding in the New Testament centered around faith in Jesus Christ. The inclusion of relevant scripture references enhances the explanation and demonstrates a good grasp of the theological concepts involved. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
