## [Answer](../New_Testament_Redemption.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Old Testament, purification was a significant aspect of Jewish religious law and practice. It was seen as a means to maintain a sacred connection between God and His people, as well as to separate them from the profane world. This concept of purification was often tied to rituals such as sacrifice, washing, and dietary restrictions. For example, Leviticus 16 describes the annual Day of Atonement, during which the high priest would perform rituals to cleanse the sanctuary and the Israelites from their sins.

In contrast, in the New Testament, the concept of purification undergoes a significant shift. The person of Jesus Christ introduces a new covenant (Hebrews 8:6) that is based on faith rather than ritual observance. Jesus' death and resurrection are seen as the ultimate means of atonement for sin (2 Corinthians 5:21), making the need for repeated sacrifices obsolete (Hebrews 9:11-14, 10:10).

This new covenant introduces a more spiritual understanding of purification. In Galatians 5:22-23, for example, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control are listed as the fruit of the Spirit—qualities that indicate a pure heart rather than adherence to rituals. Similarly, in Ephesians 5:26-27, Jesus is described as cleansing His church "with the washing of water by the word," indicating that spiritual renewal and purification come through God's word and not ritualistic means.

In summary, while both the Old and New Testaments emphasize the importance of purification, the methods and motivations behind that purification shift from rituals and sacrifice to faith in Jesus Christ and living a life according to the fruit of the Spirit.
