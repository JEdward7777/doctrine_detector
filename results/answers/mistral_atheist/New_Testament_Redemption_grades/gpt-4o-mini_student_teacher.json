  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student accurately describes the shift in the concept of purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament and mentions the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice, they could have emphasized more strongly the centrality of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate means of atonement for sin. The reference answer from the teacher provides a more concise and specific explanation regarding the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice in purifying believers from sin. The student's answer could have been improved by focusing more on how Christ's sacrifice replaces the need for ritualistic purification methods."
