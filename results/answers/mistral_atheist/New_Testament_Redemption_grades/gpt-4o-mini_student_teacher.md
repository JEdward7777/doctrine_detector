## Question [New Testament Redemption](../../../questions/New_Testament_Redemption.md)
How does the concept of purification change from the Old Testament to the New Testament?

In the New Testament, purification refers to being permanently cleansed from sin through the repentance, trust in Jesus, and His ultimate sacrifice, rather than through continual animal sacrifices.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the sufficiency of Christ’s sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin.

## [Answer](../New_Testament_Redemption.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Old Testament, purification was a significant aspect of Jewish religious law and practice. It was seen as a means to maintain a sacred connection between God and His people, as well as to separate them from the profane world. This concept of purification was often tied to rituals such as sacrifice, washing, and dietary restrictions. For example, Leviticus 16 describes the annual Day of Atonement, during which the high priest would perform rituals to cleanse the sanctuary and the Israelites from their sins.

In contrast, in the New Testament, the concept of purification undergoes a significant shift. The person of Jesus Christ introduces a new covenant (Hebrews 8:6) that is based on faith rather than ritual observance. Jesus' death and resurrection are seen as the ultimate means of atonement for sin (2 Corinthians 5:21), making the need for repeated sacrifices obsolete (Hebrews 9:11-14, 10:10).

This new covenant introduces a more spiritual understanding of purification. In Galatians 5:22-23, for example, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control are listed as the fruit of the Spirit—qualities that indicate a pure heart rather than adherence to rituals. Similarly, in Ephesians 5:26-27, Jesus is described as cleansing His church "with the washing of water by the word," indicating that spiritual renewal and purification come through God's word and not ritualistic means.

In summary, while both the Old and New Testaments emphasize the importance of purification, the methods and motivations behind that purification shift from rituals and sacrifice to faith in Jesus Christ and living a life according to the fruit of the Spirit.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 75.

While the student accurately describes the shift in the concept of purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament and mentions the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice, they could have emphasized more strongly the centrality of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate means of atonement for sin. The reference answer from the teacher provides a more concise and specific explanation regarding the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice in purifying believers from sin. The student's answer could have been improved by focusing more on how Christ's sacrifice replaces the need for ritualistic purification methods.
