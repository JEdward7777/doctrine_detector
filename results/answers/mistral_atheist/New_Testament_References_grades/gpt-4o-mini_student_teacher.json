  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures to suggest that John the Baptist may have been a Nazirite. They referenced relevant passages and interpretations to support their argument. However, the student also acknowledged the lack of explicit statements in the New Testament about John being a Nazirite and recognized that interpretations are not universally accepted among scholars. The student's answer demonstrates a good effort in exploring the connection between John the Baptist and the Nazirite vow, but they could have further emphasized the significance of the angel's announcement to Zechariah as the key evidence pointing towards John being a Nazirite."
