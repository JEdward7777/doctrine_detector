  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a well-reasoned argument connecting the angel's announcement to Zechariah with the Nazirite vow from the Old Testament to suggest that John the Baptist may have been a Nazirite. The student effectively addresses the concern of connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures to understand biblical continuity. The explanation is thorough and supported by relevant biblical passages. However, there could be more exploration of counter-arguments or alternative perspectives to strengthen the response further."
