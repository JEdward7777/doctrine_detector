However, there are some areas of concern with the interpretation given. From a Christian worldview, it is crucial to emphasize the historical and theological reality of the Great Flood as depicted in the Bible, rather than dismissing it as merely a myth or allegory. Additionally, while acknowledging various interpretations is valid, it is essential to prioritize the scriptural truth over scholarly perspectives that may undermine the significance of the account. Encouraging a deeper understanding of God's judgment and mercy in the Flood story would enhance the theological depth of the response."
