  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate description of the story of Noah's Ark as presented in the Bible, highlighting the importance of preserving life and recognizing the consequences of disobeying God's laws. However, the student included unnecessary cultural and scholarly perspectives that somewhat diluted the focus on understanding God's plan for salvation and preservation in the narrative. A more explicit connection to the biblical understanding of God's judgment and preservation would have strengthened the response."
