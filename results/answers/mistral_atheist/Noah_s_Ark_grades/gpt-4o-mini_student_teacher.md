 According to the biblical narrative found in Genesis, the purpose of Noah's Ark was to save a remnant of all living creatures during the Great Flood that God sent to cleanse the world of humanity's wickedness. The story describes Noah as a righteous man whom God chose to build an ark and take on board a male and female of every kind of animal, so that they would be preserved from the impending flood.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a detailed and accurate description of the story of Noah's Ark as presented in the Bible, highlighting the importance of preserving life and recognizing the consequences of disobeying God's laws. However, the student included unnecessary cultural and scholarly perspectives that somewhat diluted the focus on understanding God's plan for salvation and preservation in the narrative. A more explicit connection to the biblical understanding of God's judgment and preservation would have strengthened the response.
