 According to the biblical narrative found in Genesis, the purpose of Noah's Ark was to save a remnant of all living creatures during the Great Flood that God sent to cleanse the world of humanity's wickedness. The story describes Noah as a righteous man whom God chose to build an ark and take on board a male and female of every kind of animal, so that they would be preserved from the impending flood.
