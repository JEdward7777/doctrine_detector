The response acknowledges the significance of the story as a reminder of God's judgment on humanity and the importance of preserving life. However, the inclusion of the scholarly perspective on interpreting the story as an ancient myth or allegory could be viewed as potentially diluting the divine significance of the narrative from a Christian worldview."
