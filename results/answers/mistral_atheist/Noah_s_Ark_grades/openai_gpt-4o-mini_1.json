It upholds the significance of understanding God's plan for salvation and preservation within the story. The only deduction is for not explicitly mentioning the aspect of cleansing the world of humanity's wickedness, which is a key element in understanding the broader context of God's plan for judgment and salvation in the narrative of Noah's Ark."
