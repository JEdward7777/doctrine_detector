However, the response could further emphasize the understanding of God's plan for salvation and preservation in the context of the Noah's Ark story, connecting the narrative to broader themes of divine judgment and mercy. Incorporating more depth on these theological aspects would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
