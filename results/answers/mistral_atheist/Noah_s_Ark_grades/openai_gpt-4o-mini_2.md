 According to the biblical narrative found in Genesis, the purpose of Noah's Ark was to save a remnant of all living creatures during the Great Flood that God sent to cleanse the world of humanity's wickedness. The story describes Noah as a righteous man whom God chose to build an ark and take on board a male and female of every kind of animal, so that they would be preserved from the impending flood.

Grade: 75

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the biblical narrative surrounding Noah's Ark and acknowledges its symbolic and moral significance. However, the response could further emphasize the understanding of God's plan for salvation and preservation in the context of the Noah's Ark story, connecting the narrative to broader themes of divine judgment and mercy. Incorporating more depth on these theological aspects would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
