  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does acknowledge the importance of listening to God in achieving wisdom, which aligns with the concern about recognizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom. The writer also mentions that becoming wise involves self-reflection, introspection, and contemplation, which are all valuable aspects of spiritual growth.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by further exploring how one's relationship with God can lead to greater wisdom. While it is mentioned that listening to God can encourage individuals to question their beliefs, actions, and decisions, leading to personal growth, this connection is not fully developed throughout the response.\n\nAdditionally, while the writer acknowledges that not everyone subscribes to religious or spiritual beliefs, they do not provide a clear explanation of how those who do not believe in a higher power can still achieve wisdom. This omission detracts from the overall grade, as it leaves some readers without a clear understanding of how the concept of \"listening to God\" applies to their own lives.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides valuable insights into the importance of listening to God in achieving wisdom."
