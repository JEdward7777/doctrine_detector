  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a well-constructed and thoughtful discussion on the concept of \"listening to God\" and the pursuit of wisdom from a philosophical perspective. It acknowledges that wisdom can be acquired through various means, not just through religious or spiritual practices. While it offers a balanced view, it falls short in directly addressing the given answer that emphasizes the importance of obedience to God in gaining wisdom. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the concept of obedience to God and wisdom, as highlighted in the provided answer, within the context of spiritual growth and personal development."
