The connection between obedience to God and wisdom is recognized, aligning with the concern provided. However, the response also discusses acquiring wisdom through secular means, which may dilute the emphasis on the Christian-specific worldview. A more focused exploration of the relationship between obedience to God and wisdom within a Christian context would have strengthened the response."
