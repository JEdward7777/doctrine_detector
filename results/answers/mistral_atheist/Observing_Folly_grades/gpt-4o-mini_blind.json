  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses that highlight actions categorized as folly. The references to Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are appropriate and accurately capture the essence of foolish actions as depicted in the Bible. The student effectively connects each verse to the concept of folly and provides insightful explanations. However, to improve the answer further, the student could have incorporated examples from the New Testament as well to provide a holistic view of folly across both the Old and New Testaments."
