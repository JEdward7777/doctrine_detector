 In the Bible, there are several actions and behaviors that are considered folly or foolishness, often contrasted with wisdom. Here are a few examples:

1. Proverbs 10:23 - "Whoever earns money through usury brings trouble to himself, but whoever has pity on the poor lends to the LORD and he will pay back what he has given." In this verse, earning money through usury (charging interest) is considered a foolish act.

2. Proverbs 14:9 - "Foolish is the one who does wrong, but wise is he who corrects his neighbor." This verse emphasizes that doing harm to others is a sign of foolishness.

3. Proverbs 17:15 - "Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent - the LORD detests them both." In this verse, the Bible warns against injustice or taking sides without considering righteousness.

4. Proverbs 26:4-5 - "Do not answer a fool according to his foolishness, or you yourself will be just as foolish. Answer a fool according to his folly, or he will become wise in his own eyes." This passage advises against arguing with a fool, suggesting that doing so only validates their point of view.

5. Proverbs 29:1 - "A man who has many friends may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother." This verse warns against relying too heavily on the opinions and advice of many people, emphasizing the importance of true friendship.

6. Ecclesiastes 4:4 - "Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from one man's envy of another. This also is vanity and a striving after wind." This verse suggests that excessive competition and envy lead to folly and empty pursuits.

7. Proverbs 14:16 - "A wise man fears and shuns evil, but a fool is hotheaded and reckless." This verse highlights the importance of caution and avoiding recklessness or hasty actions.

8. Proverbs 23:9 - "Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words." This verse advises against sharing wisdom with someone who is unwilling to learn or appreciate it.
