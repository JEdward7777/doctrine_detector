  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the duties and responsibilities of the priests in the Old Testament, mentioning key aspects such as offerings, daily rituals, purification rituals, festivals, and the role of the high priest. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the priestly functions and their significance within the temple system. The inclusion of the disclaimer at the end regarding varying interpretations and practices adds a layer of acknowledgement of scholarly diversity. A strong answer overall, with minor room for improvement in incorporating more scriptural references to support the description of priestly duties."
