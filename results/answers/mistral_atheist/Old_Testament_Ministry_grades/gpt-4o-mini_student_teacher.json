They have effectively highlighted the key aspects of priestly ministry such as offerings, daily rituals, purification rituals, festivals and special occasions, as well as teaching and leadership roles. Additionally, they have acknowledged the significance of the high priest and the importance of atonement in the priestly ministry. However, the student's answer could have been enhanced by emphasizing the central role of sacrifices in the priestly ministry, as it was a primary way in which the priests mediated between God and the people."
