  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer clearly explains the difference between the OT and NT understandings of atonement, highlighting the shift from temporary blood sacrifices to Christ's eternal sacrifice. The student also provides relevant textual references to support their claims. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of \"permanent atonement\" in the New Testament understanding."
