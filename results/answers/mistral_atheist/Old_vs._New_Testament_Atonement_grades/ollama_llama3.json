  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60%\n\nComment: The response generally provides accurate information about the Old Testament (OT) and New Testament (NT) concepts of atonement, but it lacks depth and nuance in exploring the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history.\n\nThe answer provided is a good starting point, as it correctly identifies the OT focus on blood sacrifices for atonement and the NT's emphasis on Christ's sacrifice being sufficient for all sins forever. However, the response could be improved by providing more detail about the development of atonement theology across the biblical narrative. For example, the passage in Romans 3:24-25 cited in the provided response highlights the shift from ritualistic to Christ-centered atonement, but this transition is not fully explored.\n\nTo address the concern about clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement, a higher grade would require more explicit discussion of how the OT and NT concepts of atonement build upon one another, with specific examples and biblical references that demonstrate this progression."
