  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful answer with practical suggestions on emphasizing 'One God' while being culturally sensitive. However, the student's answer lacks a clear emphasis on the unique nature of God and the importance of the Trinity in upholding biblical monotheism, as stated in the reference answer. The suggestions provided by the student are helpful but could be strengthened by explicitly highlighting the foundational Christian belief in one God existing in three persons."
