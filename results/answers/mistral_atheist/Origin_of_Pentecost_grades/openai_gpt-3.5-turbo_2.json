However, it lacks a direct connection to how this festival finds fulfillment in Christ, which is a key aspect when considering festivals in a Christian worldview. Emphasizing the foreshadowing or symbolic significance of the Festival of Weeks in relation to the coming of Christ would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
