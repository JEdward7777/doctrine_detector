## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The term "Christian" was first used as a derogatory label by non-believers in the city of Antioch, located in present-day Turkey. This event is mentioned in Acts 11:26 of the New Testament. According to the text, the followers of Jesus Christ were initially called "Christians" because they followed the teachings of a man named Christos (Greek for "anointed one"). The term gained prominence as it became more widely used by outsiders rather than the believers themselves, who often referred to their faith as "the Way."
