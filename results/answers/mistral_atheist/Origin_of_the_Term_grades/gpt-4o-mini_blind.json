However, it could be strengthened by emphasizing that the term \"Christian\" signifies followers of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, rather than just a man named Christos. Additionally, highlighting the significance of believers identifying themselves as followers of \"the Way\" alongside being called Christians would have provided a more nuanced understanding."
