  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a solid understanding of the historical context and significance of the term \"Christian,\" accurately citing the event in Antioch as described in Acts 11:26. The response also correctly highlighted the derogatory origins of the term and its Greek translation. The student did well to connect the use of the term by outsiders with its prominence. The only slight deduction is for including a bit of unnecessary detail about believers referring to their faith as \"the Way,\" which, while relevant, could have been more concise."
