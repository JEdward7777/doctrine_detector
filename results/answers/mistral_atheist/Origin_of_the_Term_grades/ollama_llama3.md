## Question [Origin of the Term](../../../questions/Origin_of_the_Term.md)
Where were Jesus' followers first called 'Christians'?

## Correct Answer
Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians' in the city of Antioch.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing historical context and significance of the term 'Christian'.

## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The term "Christian" was first used as a derogatory label by non-believers in the city of Antioch, located in present-day Turkey. This event is mentioned in Acts 11:26 of the New Testament. According to the text, the followers of Jesus Christ were initially called "Christians" because they followed the teachings of a man named Christos (Greek for "anointed one"). The term gained prominence as it became more widely used by outsiders rather than the believers themselves, who often referred to their faith as "the Way."

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

The response provides some accurate information, mentioning that the term "Christian" was first used in Antioch and citing Acts 11:26 as evidence. However, it lacks context and significance. The response does not fully explain why the term was initially used by non-believers, nor does it highlight its historical importance.

To address the concern of recognizing the historical context and significance of the term "Christian", I would suggest adding more depth to the response. For example:

"The term 'Christian' originated in Antioch as a way for outsiders to describe Jesus' followers, highlighting their distinctive faith and practices. This label was initially used by non-believers, whereas believers themselves referred to their faith as 'the Way'. This historical context underscores the significance of the term, as it not only identified a specific group but also signaled a sense of separation from the wider Roman world."

This revised response would demonstrate a better understanding of the historical context and significance of the term "Christian", which is essential for grasping its meaning and impact.
