Who are the Hebrews descended from in the Bible?

## Stated Concern
Understanding the heritage of the Hebrew people is important for grasping Biblical narratives.

## [Answer](../Origins_of_the_Hebrews.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the biblical account, the Hebrews, also known as Israelites, were descendants of Abraham through his son Isaac and grandson Jacob (renamed Israel). According to Genesis 12:1-3, God made a covenant with Abraham, promising that through him, all families on earth would be blessed. The Hebrew people are primarily traced back to Jacob's twelve sons, who became the foundational ancestors of the twelve tribes of Israel. However, it is important to note that the biblical account is a religious and cultural narrative, and its historical accuracy has been subject to scholarly debate over centuries. In terms of genetic ancestry, modern-day Jewish populations have roots in various Middle Eastern groups, including Semitic and Canaanite peoples, with some shared genetic ties to other Middle Eastern communities like the Arabs, Bedouins, and Assyrians.
