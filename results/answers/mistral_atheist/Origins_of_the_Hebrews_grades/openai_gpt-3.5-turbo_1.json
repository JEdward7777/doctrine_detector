The explanation of the twelve tribes of Israel adds depth to the heritage of the Hebrew people as described in the Bible. The reference to modern-day Jewish populations and their genetic ancestry offers additional insight into the complexities of Hebrew heritage. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the spiritual significance of this heritage within the context of Biblical narratives."
