However, it could have delved deeper into how the act of pardon by Jesus is connected to divine forgiveness within a Christian worldview, emphasizing the sacrificial aspect and the theological significance of Jesus' atonement for sin. Additionally, a clearer distinction between secular forgiveness and divine forgiveness would have further strengthened the response."
