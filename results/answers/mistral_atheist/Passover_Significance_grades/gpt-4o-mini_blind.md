## [Answer](../Passover_Significance.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a historically informed scholar, it's important to note that the celebration of Passover holds significant relevance for Christians in connection to Jesus, primarily due to the biblical account of Jesus' last days and his crucifixion.

In the New Testament, especially in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, it is described that Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples on the eve of his crucifixion. This meal is traditionally understood as the institution of the Eucharist (Holy Communion), where Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and said, "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19). Similarly, he took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20).

The Last Supper is considered to have taken place during the Passover celebration. Jesus was crucified on what Christians refer to as Good Friday, which coincides with the Jewish Day of Preparation, the day before the Sabbath and the first day of Passover. This association between Jesus' death and the Passover is deeply meaningful in Christian theology, symbolizing Jesus as the "Lamb of God" who took away the sins of the world (John 1:29).

However, it's crucial to remember that while Christians observe this connection, the actual Passover Seder practiced by Jews today differs significantly from the Last Supper narratives. The Christian practice is a commemoration of Jesus' last meal and his sacrificial death rather than a reenactment of the original Passover in Egypt.

In summary, for Christians, the celebration of Passover serves as a reminder of Jesus' final days, his last supper with his disciples, and the institution of Holy Communion, emphasizing his role as the sacrifice that atones for human sin.
