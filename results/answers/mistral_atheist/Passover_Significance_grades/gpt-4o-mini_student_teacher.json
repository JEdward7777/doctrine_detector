  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and detailed explanation of the significance of Passover for Christians in relation to Jesus, accurately linking the Last Supper with the Passover celebration. The student effectively highlighted the parallels between Jesus as the \"Lamb of God\" and the Passover Lamb. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly addressing the connection between the Old Testament Passover and the New Testament revelation of Jesus, as outlined in the reference answer."
