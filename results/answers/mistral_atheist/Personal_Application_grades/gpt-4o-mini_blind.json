  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid overview of the Christian understanding of purification from sin, emphasizing key concepts such as the inherent sinfulness of humanity, the role of repentance and baptism, and ongoing sanctification. The student effectively articulates the centrality of Jesus Christ in the process of purification and the reliance on God's grace for transformation. One suggestion for improvement would be to include more scriptural references to support the points made."
