# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian theology, "purification from sin" refers to the process by which individuals are made righteous and free from guilt and the power of sin in their lives. This concept is rooted in the belief that all human beings are inherently sinful due to the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3). Sin separates humans from God, but Christianity proposes a means of reconciliation through faith in Jesus Christ.

Purification from sin is achieved primarily through repentance, which involves acknowledging one's sins, confessing them to God, and turning away from them with a determination to live according to God's will. Baptism is also an important sacrament in many Christian denominations, as it symbolizes the washing away of sins and the beginning of a new life in Christ.

In addition to repentance and baptism, ongoing sanctification or spiritual growth plays a significant role in the process of purification from sin. This involves seeking God's guidance, growing in moral character, and striving for holiness through prayer, meditation, good works, and obedience to God's commandments.

Ultimately, the Christian belief in purification from sin is rooted in the belief that Jesus Christ, who lived a sinless life and died on the cross as an atonement for human sin, offers salvation and forgiveness to those who believe in Him. This process of purification is not something that can be accomplished through one's own efforts, but rather it is the work of God's grace and love in the heart of a repentant believer.
