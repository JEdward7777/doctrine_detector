## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The phrase "Woe is me" originates from the Bible, specifically from Job 3:1 and Jeremiah 8:20-22. In these biblical contexts, it's used as a lament, expressing deep sorrow or despair over personal suffering or the state of the world.

In a broader cultural sense, when someone says "Woe is me," they are typically expressing a feeling of self-pity, regret, or sadness about their own situation. It implies an individual's awareness and recognition of their own suffering or misfortune, as well as a profound emotional response to it.

However, the usage can vary based on cultural context and individual interpretation. Some may use the phrase more literally, drawing parallels with its biblical origins, while others may use it more casually, conveying a general sense of hardship or misery.

As an atheistic scholar, I would approach this expression from a secular perspective, focusing on its historical and literary significance, as well as its common usage in modern language. The awareness of suffering or misfortune that this phrase implies is primarily psychological and emotional rather than spiritual or religious.
