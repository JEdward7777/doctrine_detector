However, it falls short in addressing the deeper spiritual implications of the expression as understood in a Christian worldview. It overlooks the biblical roots of the phrase and its connection to recognizing sin and the need for repentance before God. From a Christian-specific worldview, it is essential to emphasize the spiritual and moral awareness that \"Woe is me\" should evoke in individuals."
