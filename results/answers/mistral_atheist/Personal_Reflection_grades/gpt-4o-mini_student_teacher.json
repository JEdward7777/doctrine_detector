  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive overview of the phrase \"Woe is me\" both in biblical and cultural contexts, demonstrating an understanding of its general usage and emotional connotations. However, the response lacks a clear connection to personal reflection on sin or spiritual awareness, which was the specified concern. To improve the grade, the student could have delved deeper into how the expression reflects an individual's recognition of personal sin and the need for repentance or self-examination within a Christian worldview."
