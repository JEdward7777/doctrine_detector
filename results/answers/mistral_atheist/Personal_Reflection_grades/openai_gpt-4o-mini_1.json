The response focuses more on the psychological and emotional aspects of the expression from a secular perspective and does not engage with the deeper spiritual implications highlighted in the concern. To better align with the Christian worldview, the response should have emphasized the connection between the phrase and the recognition of personal sin and the need for repentance."
