 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations. However, I can provide you with historical information about the relationship between the Pharisees, Jesus, and early Christians from a scholarly perspective.

The Pharisees were a Jewish sect that emerged around the 2nd century BC, known for their meticulous adherence to Jewish law (Torah). They played a significant role in shaping Judaism during the Second Temple period. When Jesus began his ministry, he encountered the Pharisees frequently due to their influence and prominence within Jewish society.

Jesus often criticized the Pharisees for what he saw as hypocritical interpretations of the Law (Matthew 23:1-39). He emphasized ethical teachings like love, compassion, and forgiveness, which seemed to contradict some of the strict laws enforced by the Pharisees. This led to conflicts between Jesus and the Pharisees, such as the well-known story of the woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-11).

The early Christian movement emerged from Judaism, initially attracting followers who were already familiar with Jewish law and customs. The Pharisees may have viewed the early Christians as deviating from traditional Jewish teachings, especially as Christianity began to distance itself more significantly from Judaism in terms of practice and beliefs. This difference in interpretation likely contributed to tensions between the Pharisees and the early Christian community.

In summary, the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses impacted their relationship with Jesus and early Christians by creating points of contention due to differing interpretations and emphases on Jewish teachings.
