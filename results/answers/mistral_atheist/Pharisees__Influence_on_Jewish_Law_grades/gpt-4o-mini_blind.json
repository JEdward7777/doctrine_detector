However, it lacks depth in its analysis from a Christian worldview. The answer could be improved by delving into the theological implications of the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses in contrast to Jesus' teachings, such as the role of grace, salvation, and fulfillment of the Law through Christ. Additionally, addressing the spiritual significance of these interactions would enhance the response within a Christian framework."
