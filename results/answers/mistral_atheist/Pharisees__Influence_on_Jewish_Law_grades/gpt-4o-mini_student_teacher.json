  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and informative response regarding the relationship between the Pharisees, Jesus, and early Christians from a scholarly perspective. They accurately described the Pharisees' adherence to Jewish law and their interactions with Jesus and early Christians. However, the student could have incorporated more emphasis on the spiritual aspect of the law, as highlighted in the reference answer, to align better with a Christian specific worldview."
