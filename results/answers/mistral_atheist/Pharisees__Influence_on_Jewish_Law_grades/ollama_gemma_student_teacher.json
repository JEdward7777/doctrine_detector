  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the Pharisees, Jesus, and early Christians. It effectively highlights the points of contention arising from their differing interpretations of the Law of Moses. The student provides relevant historical information and cites specific biblical examples to support their claims. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the early Christian movement's response to the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Law."
