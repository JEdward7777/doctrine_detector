It effectively addresses the concern by showing how the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Law of Moses created conflicts with Jesus and early Christians due to differing interpretations. The perspective presented aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of understanding the challenges Jesus faced in his ministry. However, it could have further emphasized the spiritual significance of Jesus' teachings in contrast to the Pharisees' legalistic approach from a Christian perspective."
