  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and informative explanation of the term \"Son of God\" within Christianity, emphasizing its metaphorical and spiritual significance rather than a literal understanding of physical offspring. The student effectively references relevant biblical passages and introduces the concept of Christology for further exploration. However, the response could have been improved by explicitly stating the orthodox Christian doctrine that Jesus is the eternally begotten Son of God, emphasizing the Trinitarian nature of God, and the Son's equality with the Father in essence. Strengthening this doctrinal clarity would have enhanced the theological depth of the explanation."
