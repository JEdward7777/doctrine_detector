  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-reasoned answer that effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the term 'Son of God' for someone who believes it implies physical offspring of God. They emphasized the importance of understanding the term in the context of Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, rather than a literal interpretation of physical procreation. The student also correctly referenced key biblical passages and discussed the broader theological concept of Christology to provide a deeper understanding of the term. Overall, it was a well-structured and informative response that effectively addressed the concern from a Christian worldview."
