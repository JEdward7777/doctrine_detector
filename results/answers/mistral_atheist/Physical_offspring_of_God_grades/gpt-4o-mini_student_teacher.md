 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs, but I can certainly help facilitate a discussion on complex theological topics. In this case, the term "Son of God" is a central concept in Christianity and has been subject to various interpretations throughout history.

For someone who believes that "Son of God" implies physical offspring of God, it's important to clarify that within Christian tradition, this term is not understood as literal procreation but rather as a metaphorical or spiritual relationship. The exact meaning can vary depending on the specific Christian denomination and theological perspective.

In the New Testament, the Gospels narrate several events where Jesus is referred to as the "Son of God." These instances often involve divine affirmation from God the Father, acknowledging Jesus as His Son, rather than a biological connection. Some key passages include Matthew 3:17, Mark 1:11, and Luke 3:22, where God the Father declares, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

It's essential to emphasize that understanding the term "Son of God" within Christianity goes beyond a literal interpretation. The relationship between God the Father and Jesus, the Son, is considered central to Christian faith and often involves concepts like incarnation, atonement, and redemption.

To clarify further, one could discuss the development of Christology throughout history—the study of the nature of Christ—and how various theologians have approached the question of who Jesus is and what it means for Him to be the "Son of God." This historical and theological context can provide a richer understanding of the term beyond a literal interpretation.

Ultimately, engaging in open dialogue, discussing the relevant scriptural passages, and exploring the broader theological context may help someone who believes in a literal "Son of God" understand the metaphorical or spiritual significance this term holds within Christianity.
