  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nThis response accurately teaches that \"Son of God\" refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, rather than physical procreation. The discussion also provides relevant biblical passages and theological context to support this understanding.\n\nThe concern about proper teaching preventing doctrinal errors is well-addressed in the response. The assistant's clarification of the term \"Son of God\" within Christian tradition and its metaphorical or spiritual significance helps to prevent misinterpretation and retain the biblical terminology.\n\nOne area for improvement could be a more explicit statement emphasizing the importance of proper teaching in understanding Scripture and avoiding doctrinal errors. However, overall, this response effectively addresses the concern and provides accurate teaching on the topic."
