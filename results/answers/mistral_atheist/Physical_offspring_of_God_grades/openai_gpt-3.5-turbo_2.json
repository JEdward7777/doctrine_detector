  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of proper teaching to prevent doctrinal errors and retain biblical terminology. It clearly explains that the term \"Son of God\" in Christianity refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation. The response also provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept, referencing important biblical passages and suggesting further discussion on Christology and theological development. Overall, it offers a sound Christian perspective in handling the concern."
