  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"Son of God\" within a Christian context, emphasizing that it refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation. It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the proper teaching to prevent doctrinal errors and retain biblical terminology. The response could be improved by explicitly stating that this understanding aligns with Christian doctrine and biblical teachings."
