  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the distinction between physical death and the concept of 'perishing' from a cultural and philosophical perspective, which is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview, the answer lacks the crucial aspect of spiritual consequences and the need for belief in Jesus for eternal life. The teacher's reference answer clearly emphasizes the spiritual implications of 'perishing' in relation to trust in Jesus, which the student failed to address adequately. To improve, the student should incorporate key Christian teachings on spiritual death and the significance of faith in Christ for eternal life."
