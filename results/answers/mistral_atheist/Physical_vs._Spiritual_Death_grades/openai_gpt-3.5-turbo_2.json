  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the distinction between physical death and the concept of 'perishing' from a cultural and philosophical perspective. It correctly acknowledges the varying interpretations of 'perishing' based on cultural, philosophical, and religious backgrounds. However, the response does not explicitly address the concern raised about clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death for proper understanding. To improve the grade, the response could have included a more direct connection to the spiritual aspect of 'perishing' and how it relates to the eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus, as indicated in the provided answer."
