  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed answer that accurately captured various aspects of how early Christians expressed their fellowship. They highlighted important practices such as communal gatherings, shared beliefs, acts of charity, and personal relationships based on trust and mutual respect. However, the student's response could have been more focused on the practices specifically mentioned in the reference answer, such as listening to God's Word, praying together, sharing belongings, and eating meals together. Encouraging the student to align their response more closely with the key practices identified in the reference answer would strengthen their understanding of how early Christians expressed fellowship."
