## [Answer](../Practices_of_Fellowship.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 Early Christians expressed their fellowship primarily through communal gatherings, shared beliefs, and acts of charity. These meetings were often referred to as agape feasts or love feasts and took place on Sundays, which they considered the Lord's Day in honor of Jesus Christ's resurrection.

At these gatherings, early Christians would share a common meal, pray together, exchange Scripture readings, and engage in mutual teaching and learning. They also expressed fellowship by showing love, compassion, and care for one another, reflecting the teachings of Jesus Christ. For example, they helped each other financially when needed, visited the sick, and provided burial assistance for deceased members.

In addition to these communal activities, early Christians also formed deep personal relationships with fellow believers based on trust, mutual respect, and shared spiritual growth. They saw themselves as a new family in Christ, bound together by their faith and their commitment to follow Jesus' teachings.

Overall, the fellowship among early Christians was characterized by a strong sense of community, love, and shared values, all centered around their belief in Jesus Christ and the teachings of the New Testament.

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed answer that accurately captured various aspects of how early Christians expressed their fellowship. They highlighted important practices such as communal gatherings, shared beliefs, acts of charity, and personal relationships based on trust and mutual respect.
