  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the response acknowledges the cultural significance of the phrase \"call out to the Lord\" and offers alternative interpretations, it doesn't directly address the concern about the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life. The provided answer from which the response is being graded emphasizes the idea of seeking help, trusting, and depending on God, which is not fully incorporated into this response.\n\nThe response does attempt to reframe the meaning of the phrase in a way that maintains emotional and spiritual benefits without incorporating theistic beliefs, but it doesn't explicitly address the concern about prayer and dependence on God. Additionally, while the response emphasizes empathy, understanding, and open-mindedness when interacting with others who believe in a deity, it could delve deeper into the role of prayer in daily life.\n\nTo improve this response, the author could provide more explicit connections to the concern about the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life."
