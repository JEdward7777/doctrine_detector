Instead, it approaches the concept in a secular manner, focusing on cultural sensitivity and reinterpretation rather than acknowledging the foundational belief in God's involvement and sovereignty. A more Christian-specific worldview would emphasize the importance of genuine faith, trust, and reliance on God in prayer."
