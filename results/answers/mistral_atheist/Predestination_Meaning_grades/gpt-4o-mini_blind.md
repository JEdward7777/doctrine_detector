## [Answer](../Predestination_Meaning.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In a Christian context, predestination refers to the doctrine that God has predestined or ordained all things that come to pass, including the eternal destiny of individuals. It is one of the central themes in Calvinist theology, named after John Calvin, who was a key figure in the development of Reformed theology during the Protestant Reformation.

Predestination is often divided into two related but distinct aspects:

1. Unconditional Election: God has chosen some individuals for salvation and others for damnation, apart from any merit or demerit on their part. This choice was made by God before the creation of the world and it cannot be changed.
2. Limited Atonement (or Particular Redemption): Jesus's death on the cross was only intended to atone for the sins of those whom God has chosen for salvation. Those not chosen are left in their sin, without hope of redemption through Christ.

It is important to note that not all Christians hold this view, as it is a point of contention among different Christian denominations and traditions. Some believe in free will and reject the idea of predestination. The interpretation and application of predestination can vary significantly even within Calvinist theology.
