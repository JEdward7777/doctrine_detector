  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the privileges adopted children of God receive as mentioned in Romans 8:14-15, demonstrating an understanding of the passage. However, the response lacked a focus on the depth of the relationship between believers and God, which was the specified concern. The reference answer emphasized the personal and intimate relationship with God through the term 'Abba, Father', which was not specifically addressed in the student's response. Moving forward, it would be beneficial for the student to incorporate a deeper exploration of the relational aspect between believers and God in their analysis."
