  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer that delves into the various aspects of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in biblical prophecies, including its symbolic representation, portrayal of divine affection and anger, as well as messages of hope and redemption. The response effectively addresses the concern about recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and their historical context to apply the scriptures today. However, the answer could have been improved by directly referencing the teacher's answer and being more concise in some explanations."
