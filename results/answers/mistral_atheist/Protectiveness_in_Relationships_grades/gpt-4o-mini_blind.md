## [Answer](../Protectiveness_in_Relationships.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian teachings, a strong protective desire within a relationship is often described as selfless love, also known as agape love. This kind of love is characterized by its unconditional nature and prioritizes the well-being of the other person above one's own interests.

Here are some aspects that embody a 'strong protective desire' in Christian teachings:

1. Sacrificial Love: A strong protective desire should be willing to make sacrifices for the benefit of their partner, as Jesus did for humanity (John 15:13). This doesn't necessarily mean giving up material possessions but being willing to give time, energy, and emotional support without expecting anything in return.

2. Forgiveness: A strong protective desire involves forgiving your partner for their shortcomings and transgressions, as Jesus teaches us to forgive others (Matthew 6:14-15). This doesn't mean tolerating harmful behavior but learning to extend grace and offering a second chance when appropriate.

3. Patience and Kindness: A strong protective desire is patient and kind, not quick to anger or easily provoked (Galatians 5:22-23). This means understanding that relationships require effort and commitment, being gentle in word and deed, and showing love even during difficult times.

4. Commitment: Christian teaching values the lifelong commitment of marriage (Matthew 19:6), so a strong protective desire should be steadfast and faithful, working to build a lasting partnership based on trust and mutual respect.

5. Humility: A strong protective desire involves humbling oneself before God and one's partner (Philippians 2:3). This means acknowledging your own limitations and putting the needs of your partner ahead of your own ego or ambitions.

6. Mutual Growth: A strong protective desire seeks to help each other grow in character, as iron sharpens iron (Proverbs 27:17). This involves encouraging one another towards virtues like kindness, patience, and self-control while also offering constructive feedback when needed.
