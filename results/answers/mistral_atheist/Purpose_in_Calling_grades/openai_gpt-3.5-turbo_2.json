However, from a Christian worldview, the perspective on finding one's calling through prayer, studying Scripture, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, and understanding one's gifts and passions is essential and should have been more prominently highlighted and integrated into the secular advice provided. The secular advice given is helpful, but it lacks the crucial foundation of seeking God's purpose and direction in life, which is central to a Christian worldview. Further integration of biblical principles and reliance on God's guidance would strengthen the response."
