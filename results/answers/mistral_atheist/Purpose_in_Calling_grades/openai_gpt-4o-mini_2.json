However, it fails to address the concern of finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life. As a Christian grader, I must emphasize the importance of seeking guidance from prayer, Scripture, and the Holy Spirit to discern one's calling, rather than solely relying on secular principles. Incorporating an acknowledgment of God's role in shaping one's purpose would significantly enhance the response from a Christian perspective."
