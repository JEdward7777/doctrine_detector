## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations. However, I can provide information based on various sources, such as the New Testament in Christianity.

In the New Testament, exhortation (or admonition) is a common theme and plays a significant role. The primary purpose of exhortation, as presented in the New Testament, seems to be encouraging moral and spiritual growth among believers. It serves to inspire righteous living, promote love and unity within the community, and foster a deep understanding and application of Christian teachings.

For example, in texts like 1 Thessalonians 4:1-2, Paul exhorts believers to "maintain this mind without being disturbed; that each of you know how you ought to conduct yourself in order to live peaceably with everyone." In Hebrews 13:7, the author urges readers to "remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith."

These and many other instances throughout the New Testament demonstrate that exhortation is a tool for spiritual growth and the strengthening of the Christian community.
