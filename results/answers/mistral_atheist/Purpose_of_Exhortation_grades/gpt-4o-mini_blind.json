  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80/100\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the primary purpose of exhortation according to the New Testament. They correctly identify encouragement for moral and spiritual growth among believers, promoting righteous living, love, unity, and the application of Christian teachings. The references to 1 Thessalonians 4:1-2 and Hebrews 13:7 are appropriate examples supporting their explanation. However, a higher grade could have been achieved by explicitly stating that the ultimate purpose of exhortation is to point believers towards personal holiness and obedience to God's Word, in line with the overarching theme of sanctification found in the New Testament. Additionally, the response could have been strengthened by emphasizing the importance of exhortation in addressing sin, encouraging perseverance in faith, and building up the body of Christ."
