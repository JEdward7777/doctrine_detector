  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-informed understanding of exhortation in the New Testament, emphasizing its role in encouraging moral and spiritual growth among believers. The student accurately references relevant passages and demonstrates an understanding of the importance of exhortation in promoting righteous living and unity within the Christian community. However, the answer could be improved by further emphasizing the aspect of persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, as stated in the reference answer. It would be beneficial for the student to integrate this perspective more prominently into their response to fully align with the Christian worldview."
