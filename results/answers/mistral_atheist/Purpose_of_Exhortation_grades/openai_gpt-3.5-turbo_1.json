  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides an insightful exploration of the biblical basis for exhortation in Christianity, highlighting its role in encouraging moral and spiritual growth among believers. The integration of specific New Testament verses effectively supports the argument and demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical perspective on exhortation. However, the response could have further emphasized the aspect of persuading others to follow God's will as a central purpose of exhortation. Overall, a strong and well-supported analysis from a Christian worldview."
