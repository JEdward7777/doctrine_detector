It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting specific examples from the New Testament that support the importance of exhortation in guiding believers to live according to God's will. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly connect the concept of exhortation to persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, as stated in the answer."
