  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's answer a grade of 85. The student provides a thorough and well-rounded explanation of how Christians are expected to live a holy life, referencing key Biblical teachings and principles. However, the response focuses more on the practical aspects of living a holy life rather than emphasizing the transformational aspect by the Holy Spirit as mentioned in the reference answer. The student's answer could be improved by highlighting the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification and emphasizing the transformational aspect of living a holy life as directed by God."
