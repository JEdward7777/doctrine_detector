However, from a Christian specific worldview, the answer could have emphasized more on the doctrinal significance of parables in conveying spiritual truths, inviting listeners to deeper reflection, and revealing profound truths about the Kingdom of God. It would have been beneficial to see a stronger emphasis on the transformative and salvific aspects of Jesus' parables in leading people to repentance and faith. Additionally, the answer could have included references to Bible verses and the teachings of Jesus himself to strengthen its biblical foundation."
