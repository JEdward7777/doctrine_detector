  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the purpose of Jesus using parables, drawing on historical and cultural contexts. However, the key concern of understanding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith is somewhat overlooked in the answer. The student's response focuses more on the practical aspects of why Jesus used parables rather than delving deeply into the spiritual significance and impact of this teaching method on faith. The student could have strengthened their answer by incorporating more explicit connections to how parables influenced the faith of Jesus' followers and the broader implications for spiritual growth and understanding."
