  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the reasons why Jesus used parables in his teachings, considering various perspectives such as illustration, engagement, mystery, protection, and inclusivity. The elaboration on each perspective enhances the understanding of how parables were utilized in Jesus' teachings. However, there is a slight divergence from the given answer which focuses on the selective revelation of truth to believers and non-believers. While the response covers multiple aspects of parables, it could have more explicitly tied these reasons back to the primary purpose of revealing truth to disciples while hiding it from unbelievers."
