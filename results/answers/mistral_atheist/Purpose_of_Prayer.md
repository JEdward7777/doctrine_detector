1. Communication with God: Prayer is often seen as a means of communicating with God, expressing thoughts, emotions, and seeking guidance. It's a way for individuals to maintain their relationship with the divine.

2. Requesting assistance or favors: People can pray to ask for help, protection, or guidance in difficult times or when making important decisions.

3. Thanksgiving and praise: Prayer is also used to express gratitude for blessings received and to praise God for His goodness.

4. Repentance and forgiveness: When people make mistakes or feel guilty, prayer can serve as a means of asking for forgiveness and seeking spiritual cleansing.

5. Intercession: Prayer can be offered on behalf of others who are in need, requesting God's mercy, help, or healing for them.

6. Worship: Prayer is a way to express devotion and love for God, to worship Him, and to align one's will with His will.
