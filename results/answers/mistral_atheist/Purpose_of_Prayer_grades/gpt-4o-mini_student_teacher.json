  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides a fairly comprehensive list of the purposes of prayer in the Christian tradition, the answer lacks direct reference to seeking wisdom and confessing sins as outlined in the reference answer. Without these key aspects, the student's response does not fully encompass the multifaceted role of prayer in a believer's life. Encouraging the student to include these specific aspects would improve the depth and accuracy of their answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
