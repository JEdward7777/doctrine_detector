  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and comprehensive answer highlighting the various roles of the Psalms in Israelite worship practices. The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing the historical context and purpose of worship through Psalms. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the direct connection between the Psalms and worship experiences rather than delving into broader implications. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic is evident."
