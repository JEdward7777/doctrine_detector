However, from a Christian worldview, the central focus should be on the idea that tests allowed by God serve to expose sin, prompt repentance, and deepen the believer's relationship with Him. While the response acknowledges different interpretations, it could have emphasized more the specific Christian perspective on trials and tribulations as a means to draw believers closer to God through repentance and spiritual growth."
