The acknowledgment of the anachronistic use of the title within the New Testament is also commendable. However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing the acknowledgment of Jesus as more than just a teacher but as the Son of God in Christian belief. Additionally, a clearer distinction between the Christian and Jewish understanding of the term could have been made for doctrinal clarity."
