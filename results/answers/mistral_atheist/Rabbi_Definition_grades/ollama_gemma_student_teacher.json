  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the semantic and historical context of the term \"Rabbi\" in both Jewish and Christian traditions. It accurately explains that the term in a Christian context refers to a teacher or religious leader, while clarifying that its usage is anachronistic in relation to Jesus' time. Additionally, the student provides relevant examples from the New Testament to support their claims. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament."
