  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the term \"Rabbi\" in both Jewish and Christian contexts, explaining its traditional meaning within Judaism and its adapted use in early Christianity. It correctly highlights the translation of 'Rabbi' in the New Testament and its application to Jesus and other Christian leaders. The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament, showing a clear connection between the two contexts. Overall, a well-informed and thoughtful analysis from a Christian worldview."
