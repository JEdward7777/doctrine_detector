## Question [Rabbi Definition](../../../questions/Rabbi_Definition.md)
What does the term 'Rabbi' mean in the context of Christian teaching?

## Correct Answer
The term 'Rabbi' literally means 'my master' or 'my teacher' and refers to a Jewish religious teacher, particularly one who teaches God's laws.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament.

## [Answer](../Rabbi_Definition.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In a Christian context, the term "Rabbi" does not carry its traditional Jewish meaning as a teacher or spiritual leader within Judaism. Instead, it's used more generically to denote a teacher or religious leader, particularly those in early Christianity. However, it's essential to clarify that this usage is anachronistic, as the title "Rabbi" was not commonly used among Christian leaders during Jesus' time. In the New Testament, the Greek word for Rabbi is ῥæββί (rabbi), and it's translated into English as 'Master', 'Teacher', or 'Doctor'. For instance, in the Gospels, Jesus is often referred to as "Rabbi" by his disciples and followers. It is important to note that Christian use of the term "Rabbi" is not meant to imply a connection with Judaism's Rabbinic tradition; instead, it reflects the Jewish origins of Christianity.
