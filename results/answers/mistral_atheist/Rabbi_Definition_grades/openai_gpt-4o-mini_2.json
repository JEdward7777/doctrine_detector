It appropriately addresses the concern by discussing the use of the term in the New Testament and clarifying its significance within early Christianity. However, there could be further elaboration on how rabbinic teaching influences the portrayal of Jesus as a Rabbi in the Gospels to strengthen the Christian-specific worldview perspective."
