  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the concept of Jesus as a ransom in Christian theology, emphasizing the idea of redemption and salvation through His sacrificial death. It effectively addresses the concern by linking Jesus' role in purchasing freedom from sin to the broader concept of redemption for believers. The mention of varying interpretations within Christian denominations adds depth to the response. However, a more explicit connection to the personal implications of redemption for individual believers could enhance the overall understanding of salvation in this context."
