The timeline and key historical figures are accurately presented. However, in a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial to highlight the theological significance of these events, emphasizing God's judgment for Israel's disobedience and ultimately pointing towards the hope of redemption and restoration through Christ. Adding this spiritual dimension would enhance the answer."
