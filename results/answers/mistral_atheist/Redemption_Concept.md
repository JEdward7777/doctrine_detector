## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, particularly in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), the concepts of redemption for people and property are intertwined and have distinct yet related meanings.

The Hebrew word for redemption is "Pidyon" which primarily refers to the act of purchasing back something or someone that was sold, lost, or otherwise obligated. This concept applies both to people (often slaves) and property. For instance, in Exodus 21:8, it states that if a Hebrew servant serves six years, then in the seventh year, he shall go out free from service; but if he comes in by himself, he shall serve six years. But if the servant declares, "I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free," then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him forever. Here, redemption is associated with the act of purchasing a slave's freedom or extending servitude in exchange for piercing the slave's ear.

However, the concept of redemption extends beyond just financial transactions. In the Bible, particularly in the book of Isaiah and other prophetic books, redemption often refers to spiritual salvation. This idea is embodied in figures such as Jesus Christ, who is often described as the Redeemer, or "Go'el," a term that denotes both kinsman-redeemer and deliverer from trouble. The act of redemption in this context involves not only financial recompense but also the forgiveness of sins and liberation from oppression, often symbolized by deliverance from slavery in Egypt.

In summary, while the concept of redemption in the Bible encompasses the idea of purchasing back what was lost or sold, it also goes beyond this to include spiritual salvation, liberation from oppression, and deliverance from sin. These themes are often interwoven throughout the Bible and have had a profound impact on religious and cultural thought throughout history.
