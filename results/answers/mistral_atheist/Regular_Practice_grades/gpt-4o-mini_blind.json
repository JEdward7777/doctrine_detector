  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The student has provided a clear and detailed explanation of the reasons why the apostle Paul established the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers. They have referenced relevant verses from Scripture to support their points. However, the response could be enhanced by further emphasizing the sacrificial aspect of Christ's death and the significance of partaking in communion in remembrance of that sacrifice. Additionally, connecting the Lord's Supper to the Passover meal and its fulfillment in Christ would strengthen the theological depth of the explanation. Overall, a solid and well-supported answer."
