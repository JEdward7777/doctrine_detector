  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student's response shows a thorough understanding of the reasons why the apostle Paul established the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers, including memorialization, unity, spiritual nourishment, and reminders of moral obligations. The student effectively references relevant biblical passages to support their arguments. However, the answer goes beyond the specific concern provided by delving into additional aspects of the significance of the Lord's Supper. While this demonstrates a rich understanding of the topic, it slightly deviates from the specified concern. Overall, the student's response is well-informed and exhibits a strong grasp of the subject matter, earning a high grade."
