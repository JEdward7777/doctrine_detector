The explanation of the implications for Christian beliefs is well-articulated, highlighting the separation between Judaism and Christianity and the development of distinct Christian beliefs. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications for Christian beliefs, such as the significance of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection for Christian salvation. Additionally, connecting the rejection to the fulfilment of prophecies in the Old Testament could have strengthened the theological analysis."
