It appropriately focuses on understanding the event in its proper historical context, separating it from modern Christian beliefs. However, the response could further emphasize the spiritual significance of Jesus' mission and the recognition of his messianic status, particularly in relation to Christian teachings on earthly authority and divine missions. Overall, it effectively engages with the concern about authority, faith, and the recognition of the Messiah from a Christian worldview."
