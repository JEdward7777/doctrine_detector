  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a generally accurate explanation of how 'propitiation' relates to 'atonement' within a cultural context, specifically Christianity. However, the inclusion of the statement clarifying a perspective devoid of religious or spiritual connotations may be seen as dismissive or potentially misleading when discussing terms deeply rooted in religious contexts. It would be beneficial for the student to acknowledge the theological significance of these terms within Christianity, rather than attempting to approach them solely from a cultural standpoint. Additionally, the response could be enhanced by incorporating more scriptural references or theological insights related to propitiation and atonement in Christian doctrine."
