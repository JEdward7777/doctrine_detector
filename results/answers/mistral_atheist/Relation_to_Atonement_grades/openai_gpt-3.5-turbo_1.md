# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar, I must first clarify that my perspective is devoid of religious or spiritual connotations. In a cultural context, particularly within Christianity, both 'propitiation' and 'atonement' are terms associated with reconciliation between humanity and deity, typically following an act of transgression.

'Atonement' is a broader term that encompasses the process by which harmony or reconciliation is restored. It can be achieved through various means such as repentance, confession, or making amends for wrongdoings. The concept of atonement varies across different religious traditions but is most commonly associated with Christianity and Judaism.

'Propitiation,' on the other hand, is a specific aspect of atonement. It refers to the act of appeasing or placating a deity, typically through a sacrifice or offering. By making such an offering, individuals hope to turn away the wrath or displeasure of the deity and regain their favor. In essence, propitiation is a means by which atonement may be achieved within certain religious contexts.
