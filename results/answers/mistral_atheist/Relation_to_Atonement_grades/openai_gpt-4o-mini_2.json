  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the differences and similarities between 'propitiation' and 'atonement' within a Christian framework, incorporating scholarly neutrality while still addressing the theological implications. The response effectively clarifies how propitiation emphasizes appeasing God's wrath specifically, distinct from the broader concept of atonement. Overall, a well-articulated and informative analysis from a non-religious perspective."
