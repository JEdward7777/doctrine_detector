  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured answer that effectively explains the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God as depicted in the Bible. They have cited relevant scriptures from both the Old and New Testaments to support their points. The student could have strengthened their answer by emphasizing more explicitly that repentance is a necessary response to avoid God's wrath and receive His mercy, aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
