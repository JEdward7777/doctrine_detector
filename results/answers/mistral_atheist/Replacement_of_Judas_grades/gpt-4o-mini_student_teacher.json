  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as a 95.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation regarding the replacement of Judas Iscariot with Matthias among the twelve apostles, citing the relevant biblical passage from Acts. The student also correctly highlighted the significance of this event in Christian history, emphasizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.\n\nThe slight deduction in points is due to the inclusion of additional details and explanations beyond what was strictly necessary to answer the question. However, overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic and effectively addressed the specified concern."
