  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does a good job of describing the selection process for Matthias' replacement of Judas Iscariot, including the criterion that the candidate should have been a witness to Jesus' ministry from the beginning. The text also highlights the significance of Matthias' selection in completing the original twelve apostles described in the New Testament.\n\nHowever, there is some room for improvement in terms of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. While the response mentions that Matthias' selection demonstrates the Church's commitment to continuity with Jesus' apostolic ministry, it does not explicitly emphasize how this event marks a continuation of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.\n\nTo improve the grade, the response could more directly address the concern by highlighting how Matthias' selection and commissioning (as described in Acts 1:21-22) continue the work of the original twelve apostles, whom Jesus had appointed to spread his teachings after his death and resurrection. This emphasis on continuity would further reinforce the significance of Matthias' selection in Christian history.\n\nComment: While the response does a good job describing the event, it could benefit from more explicit attention to the concern about recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension."
