## Question [Replacement of Judas](../../../questions/Replacement_of_Judas.md)
Who was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles?

## Correct Answer
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after Judas' betrayal and subsequent death.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.

## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The apostle chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, according to Christian tradition as recorded in the New Testament, was Matthias. This selection took place following Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, and is described in Acts 1:23-26.

The disciples were gathered together, and they prayed for guidance on who should fill the vacancy left by Judas. They then set a criterion that the replacement should have been a witness to Jesus' ministry from the beginning of His public ministry. After presenting two candidates - Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias - the lot was cast, and Matthias was chosen by God.

This event is significant in Christian history because it marks the completion of the original twelve apostles as described in the New Testament. Matthias' selection demonstrates the Church's commitment to continuity with Jesus' apostolic ministry, even after Judas' betrayal and suicide.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response does a good job of describing the selection process for Matthias' replacement of Judas Iscariot, including the criterion that the candidate should have been a witness to Jesus' ministry from the beginning. The text also highlights the significance of Matthias' selection in completing the original twelve apostles described in the New Testament.

However, there is some room for improvement in terms of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. While the response mentions that Matthias' selection demonstrates the Church's commitment to continuity with Jesus' apostolic ministry, it does not explicitly emphasize how this event marks a continuation of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.

To improve the grade, the response could more directly address the concern by highlighting how Matthias' selection and commissioning (as described in Acts 1:21-22) continue the work of the original twelve apostles, whom Jesus had appointed to spread his teachings after his death and resurrection. This emphasis on continuity would further reinforce the significance of Matthias' selection in Christian history.

Comment: While the response does a good job describing the event, it could benefit from more explicit attention to the concern about recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.
