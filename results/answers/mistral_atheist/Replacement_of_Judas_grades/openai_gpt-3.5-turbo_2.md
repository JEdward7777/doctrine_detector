## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The apostle chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, according to Christian tradition as recorded in the New Testament, was Matthias. This selection took place following Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, and is described in Acts 1:23-26.

The disciples were gathered together, and they prayed for guidance on who should fill the vacancy left by Judas. They then set a criterion that the replacement should have been a witness to Jesus' ministry from the beginning of His public ministry. After presenting two candidates - Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias - the lot was cast, and Matthias was chosen by God.

This event is significant in Christian history because it marks the completion of the original twelve apostles as described in the New Testament. Matthias' selection demonstrates the Church's commitment to continuity with Jesus' apostolic ministry, even after Judas' betrayal and suicide.
