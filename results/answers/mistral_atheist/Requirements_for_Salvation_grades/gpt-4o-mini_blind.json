However, the answer could be strengthened by emphasizing the foundational belief in Jesus' atoning sacrifice on the cross as the primary requirement for salvation, as outlined in Romans 10:9-10. Additionally, it would be beneficial to highlight the doctrine of sola fide (faith alone) as a core tenet in many Protestant denominations. Overall, while the answer touches on key aspects, it could be more doctrinally specific."
