  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive understanding of salvation in Christianity, mentioning the importance of faith in Jesus Christ and the potential role of good works in some traditions. However, the student's response lacked a clear emphasis on the foundational biblical teachings of repentance and belief in Jesus as required for salvation, as stated in the reference answer. The student's answer could have been improved by focusing more explicitly on these core biblical requirements."
