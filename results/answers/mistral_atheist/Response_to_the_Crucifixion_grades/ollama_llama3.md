 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or experiences. However, I can share with you the account of the event as it is presented in Christian scriptures. In the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the book of Acts (Acts 2:36-38), there is a speech attributed to Peter where he addresses the crowd who were present during Jesus' crucifixion.

Peter acknowledges that they, by their actions or lack thereof, were involved in the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion. He says, "Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah."

However, Peter does not place blame on the crowd but rather uses the opportunity to explain the significance of Jesus' death and resurrection. He tells them that they, like all humanity, are guilty of ignoring God, but they now have the opportunity for redemption through faith in Jesus as the Messiah.

I would give this response a grade of 85.

The LLM response does an excellent job of addressing the concern by evaluating the early church's preaching, specifically Peter's sermon in Acts 2:36-38. The response accurately summarizes Peter's message, highlighting his emphasis on God raising Jesus from the dead and calling for repentance and faith. This is consistent with the provided answer.

The only areas for improvement would be to provide more context or depth in explaining the significance of Peter's sermon and its relevance to the concern. For instance, the response could explore how this message was received by the crowd or how it relates to the call to respond to the gospel. Nevertheless, the LLM response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical account and effectively addresses the concern.
