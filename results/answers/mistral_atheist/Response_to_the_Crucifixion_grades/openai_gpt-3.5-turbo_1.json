  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 90. The answer effectively highlights Peter's message to the crowd regarding their involvement in Jesus' crucifixion, the emphasis on repentance and faith in response to the gospel, and the overall significance of Jesus' death and resurrection as presented in Christian scriptures. The concern provided is addressed well with a clear explanation of the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel based on the specific scriptural reference."
