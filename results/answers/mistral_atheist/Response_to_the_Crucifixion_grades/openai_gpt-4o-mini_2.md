 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or experiences. However, I can share with you the account of the event as it is presented in Christian scriptures. In the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the book of Acts (Acts 2:36-38), there is a speech attributed to Peter where he addresses the crowd who were present during Jesus' crucifixion.

Peter acknowledges that they, by their actions or lack thereof, were involved in the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion. He says, "Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah."

However, Peter does not place blame on the crowd but rather uses the opportunity to explain the significance of Jesus' death and resurrection. He tells them that they, like all humanity, are guilty of ignoring God, but they now have the opportunity for redemption through faith in Jesus as the Messiah.

Comment: The response effectively captures the essence of Peter's message in the early church, emphasizing the collective responsibility for Jesus' crucifixion, the significance of His resurrection, the call to repentance, and the need for faith. It aligns well with Christian teachings on the importance of responding to the gospel message with repentance and faith.
