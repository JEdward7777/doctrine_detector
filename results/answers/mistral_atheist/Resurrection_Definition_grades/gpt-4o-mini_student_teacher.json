  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the Christian concept of resurrection, touching on key theological points such as Jesus' resurrection and the future resurrection of believers. The answer demonstrated a solid understanding of the importance of resurrection in Christian beliefs about life after death. The answer could have better aligned with the reference answer by emphasizing the broader concept of resurrection as the act of becoming alive again after death, attributed to God's power, while still incorporating the additional points made about Jesus and believers."
