  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of resurrection in a Christian context. It accurately explains that the resurrection refers to Jesus Christ's physical resurrection from the dead and its significance as a demonstration of his divinity and victory over sin and death. Additionally, the student connects the concept of resurrection to the belief in the resurrection of believers at the end of time. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the theological significance of the resurrection and its implications for Christian faith and practice."
