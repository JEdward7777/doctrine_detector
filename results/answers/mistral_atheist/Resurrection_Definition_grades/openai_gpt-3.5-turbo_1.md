## [Answer](../Resurrection_Definition.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In a Christian context, the term "resurrection" refers to the belief that Jesus Christ was crucified, died, and was buried, but on the third day after His burial, He rose from the dead. This central tenet of Christianity is found in the New Testament of the Bible and is considered as a demonstration of Jesus' divinity and victory over sin and death. The concept of resurrection for Christians also extends to the belief that believers will be raised from the dead on the last day at the end of time, receiving immortal bodies and entering eternal life in heaven.
