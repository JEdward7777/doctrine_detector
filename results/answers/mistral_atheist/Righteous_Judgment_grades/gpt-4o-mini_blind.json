The student effectively discusses the ideas of God's justice, love, and wrath, as well as the role of free will in understanding this tension. The reference to John 3:16 to illustrate God's love through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is also commendable. Overall, a well-rounded response but could have delved deeper into specific theological frameworks or passages that address this topic."
