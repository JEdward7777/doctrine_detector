  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of how some Christian scholars and theologians approach the reconciliation of God's wrath with His loving and merciful nature. The student effectively discusses concepts such as God's justice, the purpose of God's wrath, and the role of free will in understanding God's attributes. However, the student could strengthen their response by more explicitly emphasizing the centrality of God's righteousness and holiness in understanding His wrath, as well as connecting these aspects more directly to the provided reference answer."
