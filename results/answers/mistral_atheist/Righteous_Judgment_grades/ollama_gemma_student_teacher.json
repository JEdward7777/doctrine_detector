They also articulate the idea that God's wrath is not seen as an expression of anger or vindictiveness, but rather as a response to sin and injustice. Additionally, the student highlights the importance of free will and the consequences of choosing to sin.\n\nThe response aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher and demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian theology. However, it would benefit from more explicit mention of the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate expression of God's love and the forgiveness offered through his sacrifice."
