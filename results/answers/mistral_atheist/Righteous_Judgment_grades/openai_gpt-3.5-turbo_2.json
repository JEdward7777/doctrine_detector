It acknowledges the importance of God's attributes coexisting without contradiction in Biblical teaching. The mention of salvation and forgiveness for those who repent and believe shows a clear connection to Christian beliefs. However, there could have been a bit more emphasis on the concept of God's justice and holiness in relation to His wrath."
