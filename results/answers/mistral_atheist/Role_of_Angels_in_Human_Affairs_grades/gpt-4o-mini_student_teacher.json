  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive overview of the roles of angels according to biblical references, they missed the central focus of how angels primarily serve God, which is by delivering messages, providing protection, strengthening His people, and sometimes communicating as if they are speaking for God. \n\nThe student did showcase a good understanding of the roles of angels in biblical contexts, but they could have tied their discussion back to the central theme presented in the reference answer provided. It is crucial for Christians to understand the primary ways angels serve God in order to have a more accurate perception of divine intervention in their lives."
