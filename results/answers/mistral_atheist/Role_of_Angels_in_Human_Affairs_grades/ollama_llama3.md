 As a neutral entity, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations. However, I can share information based on research and analysis. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, angels are spiritual beings often depicted as serving God and carrying out His will. Here are some of their roles according to biblical references:

1. Messengers: Angels frequently serve as messengers between God and humans. For example, Gabriel appeared to Zechariah and Mary to announce the births of John the Baptist and Jesus, respectively (Luke 1:19, Luke 1:26-38).

2. Protectors: Angels are often associated with protecting and guiding individuals or groups. For instance, Michael is traditionally considered the protector of Israel, while Raphael protected Tobias during his journey (Daniel 10:13, 12:1; Tobit 12:15).

3. Intercessors: Some belief systems suggest that angels can intercede on behalf of humans before God. For example, in Catholic theology, there is a concept called "the communion of saints," which includes angels and departed believers who pray for the living (2 Maccabees 15:14).

4. Warriors: Angels are often depicted as fighting against evil forces. In Revelation, for instance, they wage a battle against the forces of darkness (Revelation 19:14).

5. Worshippers: Angels are believed to worship and praise God continually (Isaiah 6:2-3, Revelation 4:8-11).

6. Administrators: Some believe that angels serve as administrators of various aspects of creation and the universe, such as overseeing nations or watching over individuals (Daniel 10:13, 20-21).

It's important to remember that interpretations can vary widely among different religious traditions and within individual belief systems. These roles are not exhaustive and are based on common themes found in the biblical text.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response does an excellent job of highlighting the various roles that angels play in the Judeo-Christian tradition, including delivering messages, providing protection, strengthening God's people, and communicating as if speaking for God. The provided biblical references add credibility to these claims. Additionally, the response acknowledges the potential impact on Christian perceptions of divine intervention when understanding the roles of angels.

The only areas for improvement would be to more explicitly connect the various roles of angels to the concern about understanding divine intervention in one's life. While the response mentions that understanding angelic roles can impact perception of divine intervention, it could delve deeper into this connection and provide more concrete examples or applications for Christians.
