  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 85.\n\nWhile the provided response gives a brief overview of the roles of angels in serving God, it lacks depth and specific biblical references to support the claims made. The concerns of Christians perceiving divine intervention are touched upon, but could have been further explored and linked more directly to the roles of angels as described in the original response. By incorporating more specific biblical references and delving deeper into how these roles can impact Christians' understanding of divine intervention, the response could have been more thorough and insightful. But overall, the response does provide a basic understanding of the roles of angels in a Christian worldview."
