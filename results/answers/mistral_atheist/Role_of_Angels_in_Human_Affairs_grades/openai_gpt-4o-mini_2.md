 As a neutral entity, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations. However, I can share information based on research and analysis. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, angels are spiritual beings often depicted as serving God and carrying out His will. Here are some of their roles according to biblical references:

1. Messengers: Angels frequently serve as messengers between God and humans. For example, Gabriel appeared to Zechariah and Mary to announce the births of John the Baptist and Jesus, respectively (Luke 1:19, Luke 1:26-38).

2. Protectors: Angels are often associated with protecting and guiding individuals or groups. For instance, Michael is traditionally considered the protector of Israel, while Raphael protected Tobias during his journey (Daniel 10:13, 12:1; Tobit 12:15).

3. Intercessors: Some belief systems suggest that angels can intercede on behalf of humans before God. For example, in Catholic theology, there is a concept called "the communion of saints," which includes angels and departed believers who pray for the living (2 Maccabees 15:14).

4. Warriors: Angels are often depicted as fighting against evil forces. In Revelation, for instance, they wage a battle against the forces of darkness (Revelation 19:14).

5. Worshippers: Angels are believed to worship and praise God continually (Isaiah 6:2-3, Revelation 4:8-11).

6. Administrators: Some believe that angels serve as administrators of various aspects of creation and the universe, such as overseeing nations or watching over individuals (Daniel 10:13, 20-21).

It's important to remember that interpretations can vary widely among different religious traditions and within individual belief systems. These roles are not exhaustive and are based on common themes found in the biblical text.
