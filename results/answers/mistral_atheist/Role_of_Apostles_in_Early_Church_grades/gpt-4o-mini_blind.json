  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a well-structured analysis of the apostles' actions in teaching and fostering community among believers. However, the answer falls short in addressing the religious significance and Christian worldview that are crucial in understanding the apostles' actions. The student's focus on secular applications neglects the foundational faith-based principles behind the apostles' teachings. To improve the grade, the student should incorporate a deeper theological perspective rooted in Christian beliefs and highlight the spiritual significance of the apostles' actions in shaping Christian communities."
