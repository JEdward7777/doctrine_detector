## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations, but I can certainly provide information based on various sources, including the biblical account of the Passover. In Exodus 12, the blood of a lamb is significant in the context of the Passover event as a symbol of protection.

The Israelites were instructed to apply the blood of a perfectly unleavened lamb on their doorposts so that the Angel of Death would "pass over" their firstborns during the tenth plague on Egypt, killing all the firstborn sons in Egypt but sparing the Israelite firstborns.

Symbolically, the blood represents life and the sacrificial love of God, protecting His chosen people from harm. It also serves as a reminder of the deliverance that God provided for His people when He led them out of bondage in Egypt. The Passover is commemorated annually by Jewish people to remember this event and their liberation from slavery.
