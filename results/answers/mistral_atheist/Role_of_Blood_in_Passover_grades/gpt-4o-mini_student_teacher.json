They correctly highlighted the symbolism of protection and deliverance associated with the blood of the lamb on the doorposts. However, the response lacked explicit reference to the Christian perspective on sacrifice and atonement, which is a critical aspect of understanding the Passover event in the context of the Christian faith. Encouragement to further explore the connection between the Passover lamb's blood and Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrificial lamb would have strengthened the answer."
