  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the biblical account of the Passover, highlighting the significance of the blood of the lamb in protecting the Israelites from harm. The use of biblical references and interpretation demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, the response could be enhanced by explicitly connecting the concept of sacrifice and atonement in the Christian faith to the symbolism of the Passover lamb's blood."
