The connection between the sacrificial nature of the lamb's blood and its representation of God's love and protection is well articulated. However, the response could benefit from integrating more explicitly the Christian perspective on sacrifice and atonement, linking the symbolism of the Passover lamb to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world."
