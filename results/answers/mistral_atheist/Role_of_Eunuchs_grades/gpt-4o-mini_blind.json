However, the answer fails to address the question regarding how the role of eunuchs might reflect God's plan for different individuals in society from a Christian worldview. Furthermore, ascribing the roles of eunuchs solely to socio-political factors overlooks the potential for theological reflection on the diversity of roles in society within God's sovereignty. The response would benefit from integrating a Christian perspective on the significance of different individuals in society according to God's plan."
