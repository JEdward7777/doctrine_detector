  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the historical and socio-political contexts in which eunuchs served in ancient societies. They effectively address the concern of understanding the value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom, irrespective of their physical or social status. The student's objective and historically informed analysis avoids imposing modern religious or moral interpretations onto the experiences of eunuchs, which aligns with the Christian worldview that values individual dignity and recognizes God's universal call for all people."
