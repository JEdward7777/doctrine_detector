While it acknowledges that eunuchs held important positions, it primarily focuses on their roles in ancient societies rather than exploring how these experiences can be applied to understanding God's purposes.\n\nThe response also lacks a clear connection between the historical context and the biblical concept of God using anyone regardless of their physical state. The scholar's perspective as an atheist is acknowledged, but this does not necessarily mean that the response should ignore or dismiss the idea that God might have a plan for different individuals in society.\n\nTo improve, the response could delve deeper into how the experiences of eunuchs in ancient times can be used to illustrate God's purposes and plans. It could also explore biblical passages that highlight God's ability to use anyone, regardless of their physical state, to fulfill His purposes."
