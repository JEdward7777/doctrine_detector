However, the response falls short in fully aligning with a Christian worldview by attributing the roles of eunuchs to socio-political factors rather than recognizing the possibility of God using individuals regardless of their physical state. The perspective presented lacks a theological understanding of how God can work through individuals in diverse circumstances, and instead emphasizes historical and social contexts."
