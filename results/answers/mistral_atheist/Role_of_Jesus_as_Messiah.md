## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations. However, I can help explain how scholars and theologians have traditionally interpreted the concept of the "Kingdom of God" in relation to Jesus' role as the Messiah, based on biblical texts.

In the New Testament, the Kingdom of God is often used by Jesus to describe the reign or rule of God. It is not a physical location but rather a spiritual state of being. The concept is multidimensional and can refer to both the present (the rule of God in the hearts of believers) and future (the ultimate realization of God's will on Earth).

Jesus is often referred to as the Messiah, or Christ, which means "Anointed One" in Hebrew. This title was expected to be given to a future Jewish king who would liberate Israel from Roman rule, restore its independence, and usher in God's Kingdom on Earth. However, Jesus did not fulfill this traditional understanding of the Messiah. Instead, he taught that the Kingdom of God is not something that can be achieved through political means but rather through faith and repentance.

So, in a sense, Jesus saw himself as the Messiah who would establish God's Kingdom not by overthrowing the Roman Empire but by spreading the message of love, forgiveness, and righteousness. This shift in understanding has had profound implications for Christianity and continues to be debated and interpreted today.
