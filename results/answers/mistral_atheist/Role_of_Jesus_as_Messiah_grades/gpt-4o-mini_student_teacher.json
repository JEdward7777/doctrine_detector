  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-explained overview of how scholars and theologians traditionally interpret the concept of the \"Kingdom of God\" in relation to Jesus' role as the Messiah. However, the answer does not sufficiently emphasize the importance of Jesus' role in God's plan for humanity as the reference answer does. The student's response acknowledges Jesus as the Messiah but does not explicitly connect it to ruling God's kingdom with righteousness as the reference answer states. The student could improve the grade by highlighting Jesus' divine nature and his central role in God's redemptive plan for humanity."
