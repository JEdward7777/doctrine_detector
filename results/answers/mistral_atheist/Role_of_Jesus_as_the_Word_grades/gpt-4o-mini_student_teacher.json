  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of how the title \"The Word of God\" ascribed to Jesus highlights His divine nature and role in Christianity. The response effectively discusses Jesus' preexistence, deity, creative agency, and role as the embodiment of God's message and truth. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference concern in emphasizing Jesus fully revealing who God is and embodying God's message to humanity. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
