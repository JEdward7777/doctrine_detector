## [Answer](../Role_of_Jewish_Leaders.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 To answer this question, it's essential to delve into the historical and cultural context of the time when Jesus lived, which was during the second temple period, around 30 AD. The Jewish religious leaders at that time were primarily the Pharisees, Sadducees, and the High Priests, who held significant power and influence in both the political and religious spheres.

The tensions between Jesus and these religious authorities stemmed from his teachings and actions, which they perceived as a threat to their power and authority. Many of his teachings appeared to challenge their traditional interpretations of Jewish law, and he often criticized their hypocrisy and greed. Furthermore, some of the common people were attracted to Jesus' teachings, which could potentially undermine the religious leaders' influence among the masses.

One of the key events that led to Jesus' crucifixion was his entry into Jerusalem on a donkey during Passover, an act seen by many as a claim to be the Messiah, or the long-awaited king who would deliver Israel from Roman rule. The religious leaders viewed this event as a clear challenge to their authority and saw it as an opportunity to accuse Jesus of blasphemy.

After several attempts to discredit Jesus through various trials, they were able to convince the Roman authorities, who had the ultimate power to execute, that Jesus was a dangerous rebel and should be crucified. The religious leaders played a crucial role in orchestrating events that led to the crucifixion of Jesus by exploiting their political connections and manipulating public opinion.

However, it's essential to note that the Roman authorities ultimately held the power to carry out the execution. Jesus' death was not solely the result of Jewish religious leaders' actions but rather a complex interplay of political, social, and religious factors in first-century Palestine.
