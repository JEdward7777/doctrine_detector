  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of how the Prophet Nathan utilized a parable to confront King David about his sin of adultery and murder. The response effectively highlights the indirect approach of using a parable to bring about conviction and revelation. However, the reference answer from the teacher is more concise and focused solely on the purpose of the parable in revealing David's sin, which could have been emphasized more in the student's answer."
