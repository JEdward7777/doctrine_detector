 In the Old Testament, the Prophet Nathan utilized a parable as a clever and indirect method to confront King David regarding his sin of adultery with Bathsheba and the subsequent murder of Uriah. Here's how it unfolded:

1. Nathan visits King David in palace: Nathan approached King David and presented him a story without revealing its true meaning. This was to avoid a direct confrontation, which might have angered or embarrassed the king.

2. The Parable of the Ewe Lamb: Nathan told David a parable about a rich man who had many sheep and cattle. One day, this rich man took a ewe lamb from a poor man, who had only one lamb to nurture his family. The rich man not only stole the ewe lamb but even prepared it for a feast.

3. David's Reaction: Enraged by the story, King David immediately condemned the rich man, declaring that he deserved to die because he had committed a great injustice. He also expressed sympathy towards the poor man who was wronged.

4. Nathan reveals the truth: Upon hearing David's reaction, Nathan revealed that the rich man in the parable was him (David), and the ewe lamb represented Uriah the Hittite, whom he had taken away from Bathsheba. Nathan pointed out that David's sin of adultery with Bathsheba and subsequent murder of Uriah were equivalent to the actions depicted in the parable.

This approach allowed Nathan to confront King David about his sin without being directly accusatory, which may have provoked a negative response from the powerful monarch. The story is a great example of wisdom, tact, and moral courage in challenging authority.

Grade: 90

Comment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of how the Prophet Nathan utilized a parable to confront King David about his sin of adultery and murder. The response effectively highlights the indirect approach of using a parable to bring about conviction and revelation. However, the reference answer from the teacher is more concise and focused solely on the purpose of the parable in revealing David's sin, which could have been emphasized more in the student's answer.
