  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the use of parables in biblical narratives. The response effectively analyzes the context and purpose of Nathan's parable in confronting King David. It highlights the indirect yet impactful approach of the parable in revealing David's sin without directly accusing him. The student's explanation of David's reaction and the subsequent revelation of the parable's connection to David's actions is well-presented."
