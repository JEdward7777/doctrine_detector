  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and comprehensive overview of the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament according to the Bible. It accurately captures the diverse duties priests were entrusted with, such as temple service, ritual purification, officiating sacrifices, interpreting God's laws, judgment, prayer and mediation, teaching and learning, as well as blessings and curses. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the priestly role in ancient Israel. However, to enhance the grade further, the response could have integrated more scriptural references to support the points made and underscore the biblical foundation of the priests' responsibilities."
