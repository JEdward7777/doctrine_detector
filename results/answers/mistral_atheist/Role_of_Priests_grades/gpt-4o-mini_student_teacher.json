They accurately highlighted various crucial duties of priests beyond what was explicitly mentioned in the reference answer, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the central aspects mentioned in the reference answer, such as offering sacrifices, prayers, and teachings, before discussing additional responsibilities."
