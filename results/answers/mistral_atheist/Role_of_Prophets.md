## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 According to the Bible, a prophet's primary role is to serve as a messenger between God and humanity. They communicate God's messages, which often include warnings, judgments, promises, or commands, to the people. These messages are intended to guide, correct, encourage, and sometimes warn the Israelites about their behavior and relationship with God. Prophets are also tasked with interceding on behalf of the people to God when they have strayed from His path (1 Kings 8:29-53). In addition to this, some prophets were involved in healing, performing miracles, and even leading the Israelites during critical times.
