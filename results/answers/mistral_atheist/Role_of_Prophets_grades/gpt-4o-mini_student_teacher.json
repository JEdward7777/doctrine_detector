  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of the primary role of a prophet according to the Bible, incorporating various aspects such as communication of God's messages, intercession, guidance, warnings, and even the involvement in miracles and leadership. The inclusion of 1 Kings 8:29-53 shows a good grasp of biblical examples. However, the answer could have been more focused on the central theme of conveying God's messages and emphasizing the importance of repentance and obedience, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
