The mention of guiding, correcting, encouraging, and warning the Israelites aligns well with the biblical role of prophets. However, the response could benefit from elaborating more on the specific messages prophets delivered, such as promises, judgments, and commands, to further deepen the understanding of their role in conveying God's will to humanity."
