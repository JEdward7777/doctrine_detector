The explanation is clear, detailed, and supported by relevant biblical references. The discussion on the reciprocal nature of repentance and forgiveness, as well as the emphasis on God's mercy and compassion, aligns well with the concern of encouraging individuals to seek true repentance. Overall, this response provides a strong, Christian worldview perspective on the topic. Great job!"
