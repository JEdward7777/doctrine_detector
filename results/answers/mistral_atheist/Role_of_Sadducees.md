## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a culturally respected atheist scholar, I aim to provide historically accurate and unbiased answers. In the context you've presented, let me explain the main responsibilities of the Sadducees within the Jewish Temple System during the Second Temple period (516 BCE - 70 CE).

The Sadducees were a political and religious group in ancient Judaism, known for their strict adherence to written Torah (the Five Books of Moses) and opposition to some elements of Pharisaic teaching. In terms of their roles within the Temple system:

1. Priestly Duties: The Sadducees were a part of the priestly caste, and as such, they were involved in the daily religious rituals performed in the temple. High-ranking Sadducean priests oversaw the Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) service, one of the most important annual events in the Jewish calendar.

2. Administrative Roles: The Sadducees played significant administrative roles within the Temple hierarchy and were closely associated with the Sanhedrin, the supreme council of ancient Judaism. They were responsible for enforcing religious law and maintaining order within the community.

3. Wealth Management: Being a priestly class, the Sadducees had control over certain temple revenues, including offerings and tithes. The management of these resources was another essential responsibility within the Temple system.

4. Political Influence: The Sadducees were politically powerful due to their close ties with the Herodian dynasty, who ruled Judea at the time. They supported a pragmatic approach that prioritized maintaining peace and stability in the region over adhering strictly to traditional Jewish law.

It's essential to note that the Sadducees' influence waned after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, as their power base was largely tied to the Temple system.
