They accurately highlighted the priestly duties, administrative roles, wealth management, and political influence of the Sadducees. However, the student's perspective as an atheist scholar might have influenced the omission of the spiritual significance of the Sadducees' role in offering sacrifices and other religious practices within the Temple complex, which is a key aspect of their responsibilities in a Christian worldview."
