  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Sadducees' roles and responsibilities within the Jewish Temple System. It provides a detailed account of their priestly duties, administrative roles, wealth management, and political influence. The inclusion of historical context and relevant details is commendable. However, the absence of any reference to the teacher's answer or the concern regarding religious leadership in the time of Jesus slightly diminishes the overall score."
