The provided answer mentions taking care of the temple complex and performing priestly tasks, which is only partially accurate. While the Sadducees did have priestly duties, their main responsibilities went beyond mere maintenance and sacrifice offerings. Additionally, the response does not adequately address the Sadducees' role in the Sanhedrin or their influence on Jewish politics during the Second Temple period.\n\nTo improve, the response could delve deeper into the historical context of the Sadducees and explore their actual roles within the temple system, as well as their interactions with other religious groups and political leaders."
