  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the main responsibilities of the Sadducees within the Jewish Temple System during the Second Temple period, providing a detailed explanation of their priestly duties, administrative roles, wealth management, and political influence. It accurately explores the historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus, demonstrating a deep understanding of the topic from a scholarly perspective. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly tie the historical context back to the time of Jesus in a more explicit manner."
