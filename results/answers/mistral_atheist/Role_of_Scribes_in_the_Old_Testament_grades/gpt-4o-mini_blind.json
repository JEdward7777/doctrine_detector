However, the response lacks a Christian worldview that recognizes the Old Testament as divinely inspired scripture. It is important to emphasize the spiritual significance of the Old Testament and the scribes' role in faithfully preserving God's Word for His people. While the cultural and historical context is valuable, a more robust integration of the religious importance of the Old Testament scriptures would enhance the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
