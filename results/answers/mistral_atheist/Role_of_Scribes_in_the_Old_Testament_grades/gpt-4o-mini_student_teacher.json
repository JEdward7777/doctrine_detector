  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed and thorough explanation of the responsibilities of scribes in preserving the Old Testament scriptures, they failed to address the significance of the scribes' role in biblical history and the preservation of scripture from a religious perspective. The student's approach was solely historical and cultural, missing the emphasis on the spiritual importance of the scribes' actions in safeguarding the Word of God. It is crucial to recognize the scribes' role beyond a secular lens and understand the divine purpose behind their work in preserving the sacred texts.\n\nTherefore, the student's grade is lower due to the lack of integrating a Christian specific worldview into their response. It is important to highlight the spiritual significance of the scribes' role in preserving the Old Testament scriptures, not just their practical responsibilities."
