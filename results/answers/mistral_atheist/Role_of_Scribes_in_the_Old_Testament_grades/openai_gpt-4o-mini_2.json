  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed overview of the roles and responsibilities of scribes in preserving religious texts such as the Old Testament. The explanation highlights the significance of scribes in maintaining the accuracy and transmission of scripture across generations. However, there is a lack of explicit connection to the spiritual and theological importance of the scribes' role in biblical history. To improve the grade, the response could have further emphasized the scribes' spiritual calling to faithfully preserve God's Word and the impact of their work on the spiritual lives of believers."
