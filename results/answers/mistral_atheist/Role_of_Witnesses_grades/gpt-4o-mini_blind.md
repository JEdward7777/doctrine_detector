## [Answer](../Role_of_Witnesses.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the New Testament, witnesses play a significant role in the accounts of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. The Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) often emphasize the importance of witnesses as sources of testimony and corroboration for the events that unfolded during Jesus' ministry.

Jesus himself frequently used the metaphor of witnesses in his teachings, as a way to stress the truthfulness of his message and the need for believers to spread the good news. For example, in Matthew 28:18-20, Jesus commands his disciples to go forth and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and teaching them to observe all that he has commanded. In this passage, the disciples are to serve as witnesses to Jesus' teachings and actions.

Regarding the events surrounding Jesus' death and resurrection, there were several key witnesses mentioned throughout the Gospels:

1. The Apostles: This group of 12 (and later additional) followers of Jesus included individuals such as Peter, James, John, and Matthew. They were present during many significant events in Jesus' ministry, including his teaching, miracles, betrayal, crucifixion, and resurrection.

2. Women: In the Gospels, women such as Mary Magdalene, Mary of Cleophas, Joanna, Susanna, and others are often mentioned as witnesses to important events in Jesus' life and ministry. For example, the women were present at Jesus' crucifixion (Luke 23:49) and were the first to witness the empty tomb and Jesus' resurrection (Matthew 28:1-10).

3. Other followers: In addition to the Apostles and women, there were other followers of Jesus who served as witnesses to his life, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection.

4. The Jewish authorities: High priests, scribes, elders, and Pharisees are mentioned in the Gospels as witnesses to various events in Jesus' ministry. For example, they observed Jesus healing the sick (Mark 3:2), questioning his authority (Matthew 21:23), and accusing him of blasphemy (Mark 14:60-64).

5. The Roman authorities: Pilate, soldiers, and officials are mentioned as witnesses to Jesus' trial, crucifixion, and death. For example, the centurion at the crucifixion acknowledges Jesus' innocence in Matthew 27:54 and Mark 15:39.

In summary, witnesses play a crucial role in the New Testament accounts of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. Their testimonies serve as evidence for the events that unfolded during his ministry, and they are often used to corroborate each other's stories. The role of witnesses emphasizes the importance of eyewitness testimony and oral tradition in the early Christian community.
