The student effectively highlights how the witnesses in the New Testament served as firsthand accounts of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, which can inspire contemporary Christians to do the same. The response could be strengthened by further emphasizing the transformative power of personal testimonies in spreading the Gospel and encouraging others to faith."
