The secular perspective enriches the analysis by focusing on the societal roles and functions of the High Priest. However, from a Christian worldview, it would be important to also acknowledge and reflect on the High Priest's role as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate priesthood and sacrifice for the atonement of sins. This perspective would enhance the analysis further by connecting the historical role of the High Priest to the fulfillment found in Jesus Christ."
