However, the answer falls short by discussing an atheistic perspective and suggesting that Genesis 1:1-2 is a mythical narrative without emphasizing the Christian worldview of the text. To improve, the response should focus more on the theological significance of the Holy Spirit's presence in creation within a Christian framework."
