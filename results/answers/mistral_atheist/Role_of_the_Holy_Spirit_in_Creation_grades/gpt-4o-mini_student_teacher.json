  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough analysis of the Holy Spirit's role in the creation narrative in Genesis 1:1-2, acknowledging the symbolic representation and divine influence attributed to the Holy Spirit. However, the student's interpretation appears to lean more towards a secular and culturally sensitive perspective rather than a Christian worldview. The significance of the Holy Spirit's involvement in affirming the belief in the Trinity and the collaborative work of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as highlighted in the concern is not fully addressed or emphasized in the response."
