However, it falls short of addressing the concern about how recognizing the Holy Spirit's role in creation helps Christians appreciate the unity and collaborative work of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit from a Christian worldview perspective. The response missed an opportunity to further connect the significance of the Holy Spirit's involvement to the overall understanding of the Triune God in creation."
