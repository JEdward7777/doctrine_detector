However, the concern was for clarity on the role of the Messiah to help believers comprehend Jesus's mission and authority. The answer could have been more focused and concise in aligning with the reference answer given by the teacher, which highlights the Messiah as a prophet, a priest, and a king starting the New Covenant. While the student covered additional roles, they could have better emphasized the core roles for better clarity and understanding."
