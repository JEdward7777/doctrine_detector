# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christianity, as outlined in the New Testament of the Bible, the Messiah, who is identified as Jesus Christ, fulfills several key roles:

1. Redeemer: According to Christian belief, Jesus came to redeem humanity from sin. This is based on the teachings that all people have sinned and are therefore separated from God, but through Jesus' sacrifice (his death and resurrection), salvation and reconciliation with God becomes possible.

2. Prophet: Jesus is often considered a prophet in the line of other great Jewish prophets like Moses or Isaiah. He is believed to have spoken the word of God to guide his followers and teach them about God's will.

3. King: Jesus is also seen as a king, not in a political sense, but as a spiritual leader who rules over those who believe in him. The term "Kingdom of God" is frequently used in the Bible to describe this spiritual realm that Jesus introduced.

4. Suffering Servant: This role is based on passages from the Old Testament's book of Isaiah, particularly chapters 52 and 53. These passages describe a servant who would be despised and rejected, suffer greatly, but ultimately vindicated and exalted. Christians believe Jesus fulfilled this prophecy through his crucifixion and resurrection.

5. Son of God: Jesus is often referred to as the "Son of God" in the New Testament. This title signifies a unique relationship with God, indicating that Jesus is not just any human being but has a divine nature.

6. High Priest: In Christian theology, Jesus serves as the high priest who intercedes on behalf of humans before God, making it possible for people to approach God directly.
