## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar without religious beliefs, I don't personally subscribe to the existence of God or divine instructions. However, I can provide information on the biblical account of manna and its relationship with the Sabbath as it is presented in the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 16:22-30).

According to this narrative, during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, God provided them with manna, a miraculous food, as a substitute for their lost daily sustenance. On Friday, just before sunset (the beginning of the Jewish Sabbath), God instructed that no manna should be gathered on that day. Instead, the Israelites were to gather a double portion on the sixth day so that none would have to go out and collect it on the Sabbath. This is an important aspect of the story as it emphasizes the importance of observing the Sabbath rest even amidst survival needs.

Grade: 80

The response partially addresses the concern about the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands by providing a biblical account that emphasizes the significance of resting on the Sabbath day. The mention of God instructing the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna the day before the Sabbath is also relevant to this concern.

However, the response could have gone further in exploring the importance of observing the Sabbath as commanded by God. For instance, it would have been beneficial to include more biblical references and explanations about why the Sabbath was considered a sacred institution by the Israelites and later by Christians. Additionally, the response could have explored the spiritual significance of resting on the Sabbath day and how this practice relates to our relationship with God.

Overall, while the response provides some relevant information, it could be improved by delving deeper into the biblical account and its implications for observing the Sabbath as commanded by God.
