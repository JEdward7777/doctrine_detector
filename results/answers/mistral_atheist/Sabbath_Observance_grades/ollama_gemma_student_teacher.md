## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 According to the account in the Old Testament, the Sabbath, or the seventh day of the week (Saturday), was instituted by God as a day of rest and reverence. The commandment to observe the Sabbath is found in Exodus 20:8-11 and Deuteronomy 5:12-15.

In these passages, the Sabbath is described as a day of rest, holy convocation (a gathering for worship), and refraining from work. Work is defined broadly to include any labor or task that might be performed by servants, animals, or even wild beasts (Exodus 20:10). The purpose of the Sabbath is to remember and celebrate God's creation and deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt.

While the specific observance of the Sabbath has evolved over time and varies among different Jewish and Christian traditions, the fundamental principles remain the same: to set aside a day for rest, reflection, worship, and gratitude for the gifts of life and creation.
