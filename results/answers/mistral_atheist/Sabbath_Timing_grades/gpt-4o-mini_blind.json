However, the response could have been strengthened by emphasizing the significance of the Sabbath as a commandment from God to the Jewish people, highlighting its observance as a sacred and set-apart time. Additionally, tying this observance to the theological understanding of rest and relationship with God would have enriched the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
