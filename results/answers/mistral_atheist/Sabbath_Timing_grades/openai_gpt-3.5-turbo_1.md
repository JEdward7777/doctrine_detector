## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Jewish tradition, the Sabbath (Shabbat) is observed from sundown on Friday evening to sundown on Saturday evening. This timeframe follows the ancient practice based on the creation narrative in the Book of Genesis (2:1-3), where God rested on the seventh day, which Jews interpret as starting from Friday evening and ending on Saturday evening.

It's important to note that the specific timing can vary slightly among different Jewish communities due to regional differences and the intricacies involved in calculating sunset based on astronomical observations. However, this basic timing of Friday evening to Saturday evening remains consistent across most Jewish traditions.
