The practical applications given align well with the Christian worldview of selflessly loving others. However, the response could further emphasize the divine nature of God's love and how that should serve as the foundational inspiration for sacrificial love in personal relationships. Integrating this deeper theological aspect would enhance the overall understanding of sacrificial love within the context of God's love and its reflection in our interactions with others."
