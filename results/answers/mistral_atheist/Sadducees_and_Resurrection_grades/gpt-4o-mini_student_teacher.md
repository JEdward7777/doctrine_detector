## [Answer](../Sadducees_and_Resurrection.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The Sadducees were a conservative Jewish political and priestly sect during the Second Temple period, primarily based in Jerusalem. They rejected the beliefs in immortality, spiritual world, and active intervention of God in human life and affairs, including the concept of resurrection, which was central to Pharisaic belief.

According to Sadduceean belief, there was no resurrection or afterlife as described in Jewish eschatology. They based their rejection on a literal interpretation of the Torah, claiming that the idea of bodily resurrection was not mentioned in it. This is in contrast with Christian teaching, which states that God raised Jesus from the dead and that believers will be resurrected at the end of time. In Christianity, this belief in resurrection is tied to the concept of eternal life, the soul's survival after death, and the ultimate triumph over death through faith in Jesus Christ.

They highlighted the key differences in beliefs and their implications for faith, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic.
