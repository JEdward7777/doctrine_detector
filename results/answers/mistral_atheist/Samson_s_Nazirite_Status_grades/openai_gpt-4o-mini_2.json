  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed analysis of Samson's story in relation to the Nazirite vow, highlighting the importance of personal commitment in fulfilling divine purpose. The student effectively connects the significance of adherence to the vow, particularly the prohibition against cutting hair, to Samson's strength. However, it would have been beneficial to further emphasize the ultimate consequences of Samson's failure to uphold his commitment, leading to his downfall. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives."
