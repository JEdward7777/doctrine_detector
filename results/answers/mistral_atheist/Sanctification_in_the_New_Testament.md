## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian theology, as presented in the New Testament, sanctification refers to the process by which a person who has accepted faith in Jesus Christ is made holy or set apart for God. This process is viewed as a lifelong journey rather than an immediate transformation upon conversion.

The sanctification process is described in several passages throughout the New Testament. Here are some key points:

1. Justification by Faith (Romans 3:21-31, Ephesians 2:8-9): This is the initial step of salvation where a person accepts Jesus Christ as their savior through faith. It is through this act that they are justified or declared righteous before God, setting them on the path to sanctification.

2. Being Transformed by Renewal (Romans 12:2): The believer is called to be transformed by the renewing of their mind. This transformation occurs as they live according to the will of God, conforming their lives to Jesus Christ.

3. Putting Off the Old Self and Putting on the New (Ephesians 4:22-24): Believers are called to put away their old sinful nature and put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

4. Being Sanctified by God (1 Thessalonians 4:3): Believers are commanded to live a life of holiness because God has called them to be holy. This sanctification is both a command and a gift from God.

5. Growth in Grace and Knowledge (2 Peter 3:18): The believer is called to grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, with the goal of becoming more like Him.

6. Becoming More Mature in Christ (Colossians 1:9-10): Believers are encouraged to bear fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to His glorious might so that they may have great endurance and patience, and giving joyful thanks to the Father.

Throughout this process, believers are supported by the Holy Spirit who dwells within them (Romans 8:9-11), providing guidance, strength, and encouragement. The ultimate goal is to become more like Jesus Christ, living a life pleasing to God.
