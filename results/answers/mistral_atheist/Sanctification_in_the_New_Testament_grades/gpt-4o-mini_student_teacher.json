  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the sanctification process for believers in Jesus, referencing key passages from the New Testament. The student has effectively highlighted the importance of faith in the sanctification process and how it is a lifelong journey of transformation towards becoming more like Christ. However, the student's answer might be considered slightly verbose and could benefit from a more concise and focused presentation of the information.\n\nOverall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of sanctification in Christian theology and has effectively addressed the concern regarding the role of faith in the process."
