  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response accurately states that God sanctifies people who believe in Jesus, making them holy and setting them apart to serve Him. This aligns with the concern of recognizing the role of faith in the process of sanctification. The response also provides some biblical support for the concept of sanctification, mentioning key passages such as Romans 3:21-31 and Ephesians 2:8-9.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response does not provide a more detailed explanation of the sanctification process, nor does it delve into the role of faith in this process. The answer primarily focuses on the fact that God sanctifies people who believe in Jesus, without explicitly highlighting the importance of faith in bringing about this transformation.\n\nOverall, I would say that this is a solid response that demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of sanctification, but could be improved by providing more specific examples and explanations."
