The mention of the Tabernacle, Temple, and the concept of God's presence dwelling among the Israelites demonstrates a good understanding of biblical history. To improve, the answer could delve deeper into the theological implications of sanctuary, such as the symbolism of sanctuary as a foreshadowing of Christ as our ultimate refuge and sanctification."
