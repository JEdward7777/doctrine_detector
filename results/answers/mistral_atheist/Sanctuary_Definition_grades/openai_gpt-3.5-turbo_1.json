It correctly identifies the sanctuary as a holy place set apart by God for worship and protection, using the examples of the tabernacle and temple. The response could have elaborated further on the spiritual significance of the sanctuary as a place where God's presence dwells and where believers can seek refuge and find safety in His protection."
