## [Answer](../Sanctuary_Definition.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of the Bible, a sanctuary refers to a sacred place set apart for religious worship or ceremonies. The Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem were considered as such, where God's presence was believed to dwell among the Israelites. In biblical times, these sanctuaries served as the central location for ritual observance and prayer. In some instances, the term "sanctuary" also refers to a place of refuge or protection, often associated with the Law of Moses which allowed a fugitive to find temporary safety within its walls if they could reach it before sunset.
