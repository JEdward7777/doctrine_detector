  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid overview of how God described the sanctuary in relation to His people in the Old Testament. The student accurately discusses the significance of the Tabernacle and later Temple as sacred spaces set apart for God's presence among the Israelites. Additionally, the mention of the divisions within the sanctuary and its symbolism in terms of holiness and separation is well articulated. However, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological implications of the sanctuary in conveying God's holiness and the importance of sacrifices for atonement. Greater emphasis on the unique nature of the Israelite sanctuary compared to other ancient Near Eastern religious practices would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the response."
