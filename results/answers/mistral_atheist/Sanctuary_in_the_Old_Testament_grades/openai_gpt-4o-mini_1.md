 In the Old Testament, the concept of a sanctuary, often referred to as the Tabernacle or Temple, plays a significant role in describing the relationship between God and his chosen people, the Israelites. The Tabernacle was a portable structure that followed the Israelites during their wandering in the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt (Exodus 25-40). Later, King Solomon built the first Temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 6).

The sanctuary is described as a sacred space set apart for God's presence among his people. It was divided into three main parts: the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place within it, and the outer Courtyard. The Holy of Holies, also known as the Ark of the Covenant's resting place, represented God's throne on earth (Exodus 25:22).

The sanctuary served as a symbolic boundary between the divine and human realms, emphasizing the Israelites' need for holiness and separation from the common world. Offerings and sacrifices were made at the sanctuary to atone for sins and maintain the relationship with God.

From a scholarly perspective, it is essential to consider these descriptions within their historical and cultural context. The Old Testament reflects ancient Near Eastern religious practices, including the concept of sacred spaces and temples that housed gods. Understanding the symbolism and function of the sanctuary in the context of ancient Israelite religion helps us appreciate its significance for the people and its role in shaping the development of monotheistic traditions.
