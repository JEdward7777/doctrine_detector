  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a comprehensive and well-reasoned response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian theological perspective on the fate of Satan and his followers in hell. The student correctly identifies the common belief in Christian tradition as outlined in the Bible and offers a nuanced explanation of the symbolic nature of Hell as separation from God. Additionally, the student acknowledges the absence of empirical evidence for supernatural beings and adopts a skeptical approach to the topic, which aligns with their atheistic perspective."
