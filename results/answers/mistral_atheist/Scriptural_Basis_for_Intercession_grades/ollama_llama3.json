  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides several biblical examples of intercession, which aligns with the concern to encourage believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. However, it only partially addresses the concern as the answer provided is not identical to the ones mentioned in the response. Nevertheless, the response effectively highlights various instances of intercession in both the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament, emphasizing Jesus' role as an eternal intercessor for humanity."
