# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian scriptures, there are several verses that discuss the concept of intercession – praying or acting on behalf of others. Here are a few examples from both the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament:

1. Old Testament:
   - Exodus 32:11-14: In this passage, Moses intercedes for the Israelites who have made a golden calf and asks God to spare them. God relents due to Moses' intervention.
   - Numbers 27:18-23: Here, God commands Moses to appoint Joshua as his successor and allows Moses' brother Eleazar to lay his hands on Joshua in the act of transferring leadership, symbolizing the passing on of God's authority. This can be seen as an example of intercession as well.
   - Daniel 9:4-19: In this chapter, Daniel fasts and prays for the forgiveness of Israel and asks God to restore Jerusalem. His prayers are heard, and the prophecy of seventy weeks is revealed to him.

2. New Testament:
   - Matthew 18:19-20: Jesus says, "Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them." This verse emphasizes the power of prayer and intercession when done in community.
   - Romans 8:34: Paul writes that Christ Jesus "who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us." Here, Jesus is portrayed as an eternal intercessor on behalf of humanity.
   - Hebrews 7:25: The author of Hebrews states that Jesus "is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them." This verse further emphasizes Jesus' role as an intercessor.
