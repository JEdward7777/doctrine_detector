  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of various verses from both the Old Testament and the New Testament that discuss intercession and prayer. It effectively highlights examples of intercession by key figures such as Moses, Daniel, and Jesus Himself, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, there is room for improvement in directly addressing the concern of encouraging believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. While the response does present relevant verses, it could have been more explicit in emphasizing the importance of personal engagement with Scripture for spiritual growth and understanding in the practice of prayer and intercession."
