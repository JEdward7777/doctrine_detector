## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 Propitiation is a theological term primarily used within Christianity to describe the act of appeasing or conciliating a deity, especially by expiation for sin. The concept is deeply rooted in many parts of the Bible, particularly in the Old and New Testaments. Here are some verses that explicitly discuss propitiation:

1. Leviticus 16:2 - "Speak unto Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud above the mercy seat." This verse sets the stage for the Day of Atonement, when the High Priest would make propitiation for the Israelites.

2. Romans 3:25 - "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God." This verse from the Apostle Paul's letter to the Romans explains Jesus as a propitiation.

3. 1 John 2:2 - "And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world." This verse further emphasizes Jesus' role in propitiation for all mankind.

4. 1 John 4:10 - "In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins." Here, John discusses how Jesus came to earth as a means of appeasing God's wrath against sin.

These verses illustrate the role of propitiation in Christian theology, whereby an offering or sacrifice is made to appease a deity and remove their wrath or punishment for sins. However, interpretations can vary among different denominations and individual believers.
