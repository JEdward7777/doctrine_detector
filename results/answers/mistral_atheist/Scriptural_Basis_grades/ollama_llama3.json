  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of providing biblical references to support the concept of propitiation, including verses from Leviticus, Romans, and 1 John. The explanations of each verse are clear and concise, and the response effectively connects the theological concept with biblical references for deeper understanding.\n\nOne area for improvement is that the response could have delved a bit deeper into the significance of propitiation in Christian theology. While it's mentioned that interpretations can vary among different denominations and individual believers, the response doesn't explore the implications of Jesus as the propitiation for our sins or how this concept relates to other theological concepts.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively connects biblical references with the concept of propitiation."
