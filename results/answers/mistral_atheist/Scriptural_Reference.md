## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, the concept of the "world" (Kosmos in Greek) often carries multiple meanings depending on the context. Here are a few passages that discuss the relationship between the world and believers:

1. John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." This passage suggests that God loves the entire world, but salvation is granted to those who believe in Jesus Christ.

2. Romans 12:2 - "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the will of God—what is good and acceptable and perfect." This passage calls believers to live differently than the world, according to God's will.

3. 1 John 2:15-17 - "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in them. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever keeps God’s words lives forever." This passage warns against loving the world, focusing on material possessions or pleasures, which are temporary and will pass away, contrasted with eternal life through adherence to God's word.

4. 2 Corinthians 5:17 - "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" This passage emphasizes that believers are part of a new creation in Christ, separated from the old, sinful world.

5. Colossians 3:1-4 - "Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory." This passage encourages believers to focus on spiritual things rather than the physical world.

These passages suggest that while believers are part of the world physically, they are called to live spiritually and morally distinct from it, focusing on eternal life and God's will.
