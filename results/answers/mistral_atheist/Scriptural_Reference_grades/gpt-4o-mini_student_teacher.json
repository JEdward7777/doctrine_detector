  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful exploration of biblical passages addressing the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers, offering a nuanced understanding of the topic. However, the student missed the key focus of how to navigate life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values, which was the specified concern. Integrating more direct application of the biblical passages to the concern would have strengthened the response."
