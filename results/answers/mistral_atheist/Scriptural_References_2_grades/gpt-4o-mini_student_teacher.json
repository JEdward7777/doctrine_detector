  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 75.\n\nWhile the student provided relevant and detailed passages supporting the concept of the Day of Judgment, the reference answer from the teacher includes key passages that were not mentioned by the student. Encouraging the student to include a wider range of key passages would enrich their answer and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the scriptural basis for the concept of the Day of Judgment."
