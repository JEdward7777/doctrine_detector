## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christianity, the concept of the Day of Judgment is a significant theme that appears throughout the Bible. Here are a few passages that reference this idea:

1. Matthew 25:31-46 (The Sheep and the Goats) - This passage is often referred to as the "Parable of the Sheep and the Goats." Jesus describes a future time when he will separate the righteous from the unrighteous, sending the former into eternal life and the latter into eternal punishment.

2. John 12:48 (The Judge) - In this verse, Jesus says, "The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has something to judge him: The word I have spoken will judge him on the last day."

3. Acts 17:30-31 (The Unknown God) - In this passage, Paul addresses the Areopagus in Athens and speaks of a future Day of Judgment when God will judge the world by a man whom he has appointed; and he has given assurance of this to all by raising him from the dead.

4. Revelation 20:11-15 (The Final Judgment) - This passage from the Book of Revelation describes the final judgment, where the dead are raised, the book of life is opened, and each person is judged according to their deeds. Those whose names are not found in the book of life are thrown into the lake of fire.

5. 2 Corinthians 5:10 (We Must All Appear Before Christ) - In this verse, Paul writes that we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; so that each one may receive what is due him for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.

These passages suggest that the Day of Judgment is a time when all people will be judged by God based on their actions and beliefs. This concept is central to Christian eschatology. However, it's important to note that interpretations can vary among different Christian denominations and traditions.
