  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: This response provides a solid analysis of Matthew 23:27-28, highlighting the hypocrisy and internal corruption of the Pharisees. The interpretation is accurate and aligns well with Christian teachings on the nature of iniquity. However, the response could have delved deeper into the spiritual consequences of such hypocrisy and how it separates individuals from God. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references or theological insights could have strengthened the analysis further."
