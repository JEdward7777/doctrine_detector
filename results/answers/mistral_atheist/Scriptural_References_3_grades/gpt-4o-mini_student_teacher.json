  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the passage and analyzed the nature of iniquity depicted in Matthew 23:27-28. However, the student could have more directly connected the passage to the concern of pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards. The response could have delved deeper into the importance of integrity in one's faith and how it relates to the pursuit of genuine holiness. Overall, a solid understanding of the passage was demonstrated, but a stronger connection to the Christian worldview concern would have improved the grade."
