  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately summarizes Matthew 23:27-28, highlighting Jesus' criticism of the Pharisees for their outward appearance of righteousness while being inwardly corrupt. The two ways to understand the nature of iniquity (outwardly righteous but inwardly corrupt and hypocrisy) are also well-articulated. Additionally, the conclusion effectively applies the passage's message to contemporary Christian life, emphasizing the importance of integrity in one's faith.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement. While the response touches on the concern about pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards, it could be more explicit and detailed in this regard. For example, the writer could have explored how this passage serves as a warning against superficial Christianity or emphasized the importance of heart transformation over mere outward conformity.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical text and its relevance to Christian living, but could benefit from further development and application of the concern."
