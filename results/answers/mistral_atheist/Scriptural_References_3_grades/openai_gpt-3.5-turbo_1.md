# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or values, but I can help interpret and analyze texts such as Matthew 23:27-28 from a scholarly perspective. This passage reads:

"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. So you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness."

In this passage, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees, a group of religious leaders in Jewish society during his time. The term "iniquity" or "lawlessness" in this context refers to actions that violate God's law.

The nature of iniquity, as portrayed in this passage, can be understood in two ways:

1. Outwardly righteous but inwardly corrupt: The Pharisees were known for their strict adherence to religious laws and practices, which made them appear righteous to others. However, Jesus accuses them of being hypocrites, suggesting that they do not practice what they preach or follow the law in their hearts. This highlights the danger of performing religious acts solely for external recognition rather than internal motivation.

2. Hypocrisy: The Pharisees' actions are inconsistent with their professed beliefs. They portray themselves as righteous, but their hearts are filled with hypocrisy, which is essentially deceit and insincerity. This passage suggests that the nature of iniquity lies in dishonesty and insincerity, both towards oneself and others.

In conclusion, this passage can be seen as a critique of the Pharisees' outward piety concealing inner corruption, hypocrisy, and lawlessness, shedding light on the nature of iniquity as deceitful actions that violate one's true beliefs or moral standards.
