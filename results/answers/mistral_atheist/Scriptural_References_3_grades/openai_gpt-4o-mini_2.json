It effectively explores the themes of outward appearances versus inner righteousness, highlighting the significance of integrity in faith. The interpretation aligns well with the concern provided, emphasizing the importance for Christians to pursue genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance. The explanation is clear, insightful, and offers a meaningful reflection on the passage. Great work!"
