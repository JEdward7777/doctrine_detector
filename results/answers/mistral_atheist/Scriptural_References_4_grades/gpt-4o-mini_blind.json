  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid analysis of the concept of birthright in the chosen Biblical passages, highlighting its significance in cultural, familial, and spiritual contexts. The explanations are clear and demonstrate an understanding of the broader implications of birthright in the Bible. One suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate more direct connections to the overarching theme of God's covenant and sovereignty in relation to birthright, especially in the Old Testament passages."
