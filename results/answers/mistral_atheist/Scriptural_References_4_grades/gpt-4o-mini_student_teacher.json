  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive analysis of the passages related to birthright, highlighting cultural, familial, and spiritual aspects. The student successfully draws out the significance of birthright in each passage and connects them to broader themes within Biblical teachings. However, the student could strengthen their answer by directly addressing the reference answer from the teacher, specifically focusing on the value of birthright in God's plan, the importance of holiness, and the consequences of neglecting one's spiritual inheritance. By aligning their analysis more closely with the given reference answer, the student could enhance the coherence and depth of their response."
