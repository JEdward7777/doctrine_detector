  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student provides a clear analysis of three biblical passages that demonstrate the significance of birthright in different contexts: cultural, familial, and spiritual. The student's discussion is well-organized and easy to follow, with effective transitions between paragraphs.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because the student's response does not directly address the concern about scripture interpretation and its relevance to contemporary Christian life. While the student provides a biblical analysis, it could be strengthened by explicitly exploring how these passages might apply to modern Christians' lives.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates strong biblical knowledge and critical thinking skills, but could improve by more explicitly linking their analysis to the question's concern about scripture interpretation."
