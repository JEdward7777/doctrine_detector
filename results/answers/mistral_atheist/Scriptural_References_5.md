## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The New Testament does indeed suggest a change in the Jewish concept of Hades, primarily from a neutral resting place for all the dead to a place associated more closely with the unrighteous or wicked. This shift can be seen in several verses that contrast Hades with heaven and hell. Here are a few examples:

1. Luke 10:15 - "And you, Capernaum, who are you exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades." Here, Jesus appears to use Hades as a place of judgment or punishment, contrasting it with heaven.

2. Acts 2:27 - "Because you did not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor did you let my body see decay." This quote from Psalm 16 is interpreted by Peter in this passage as a prophecy about Jesus, suggesting that he was not left in Hades (the realm of the dead) but experienced resurrection.

3. Acts 2:31 - "He saw his ancestor David, who had fallen asleep, and he declared: 'I always thought David would never see my kingdom; yet he has entered it!'" Here, David is described as having "fallen asleep," which was a Jewish idiom for death, but then Jesus declares that David did not stay in Hades. This again suggests a change in understanding of Hades.

4. Revelation 1:18 - "I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades." In this verse, Jesus is portrayed as having power over both death and Hades, suggesting they are places of ultimate judgment or defeat.

These verses reflect the evolution of Jewish beliefs about the afterlife in the New Testament era, influenced by Christian teachings about the resurrection and final judgment. However, it's important to note that interpretations can vary among scholars and religious communities.
