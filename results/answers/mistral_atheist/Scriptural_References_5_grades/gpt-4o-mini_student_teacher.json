  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 90. The student has provided a detailed analysis of several New Testament verses that indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades from a neutral place for all the dead to a location associated with the unrighteous. They have effectively shown the contrast between Hades, heaven, and hell in the verses they have cited. However, the teacher's reference answer does provide a more concise and specific example that directly addresses the question. Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and provided relevant scriptural evidence, although the response could have been further improved by directly referencing the examples from Luke presented in the teacher's reference answer."
