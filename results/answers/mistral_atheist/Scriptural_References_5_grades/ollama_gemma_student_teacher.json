  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the shift in understanding Hades from a neutral place to one associated with the unrighteous in the New Testament. The student provides relevant textual evidence from various passages to support their claim. Additionally, they acknowledge the influence of Christian teachings about the resurrection and judgment on the evolution of these beliefs.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by including more direct references to the verses mentioned in the reference answer, such as Luke 16:23 and Luke 23:43. This would strengthen the student's argument and demonstrate a closer engagement with the provided concern."
