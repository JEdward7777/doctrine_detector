  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of various New Testament verses that suggest a shift in the understanding of Hades from a neutral resting place to a place associated with the unrighteous or wicked. The additional verses cited support the argument well and demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic. The response effectively addresses the concern by expanding on the scriptural evidence and its implications for Christian eschatology in a clear and insightful manner. Overall, a well-researched and well-articulated response."
