  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of scriptural evidence regarding the evolving understanding of Hades in the New Testament. It effectively uses specific verses to support the idea of a shift in the concept of Hades from a neutral resting place to a place associated with the unrighteous or wicked. The response engages with the concern by discussing multiple verses and their implications for Christian eschatology. Overall, the analysis is well-supported and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
