The analysis is clear and supported by relevant scriptural references. To enhance the answer, the student could have delved deeper into the theological significance of Christ's exaltation and its implications for believers, tying in concepts such as redemption, atonement, and the sovereignty of God. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic is displayed in this response."
