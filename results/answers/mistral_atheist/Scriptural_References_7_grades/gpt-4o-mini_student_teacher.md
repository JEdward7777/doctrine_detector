## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_7.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11 both provide insightful perspectives on the concept of exaltation within the Christian faith, emphasizing humility and divine elevation as key aspects.

In 1 Peter 5:5-7, the apostle Peter is writing to "the elders" (or leaders) among the early Christian communities. He encourages them to clothe themselves with humility, for God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. Furthermore, he states that all of us must bear our share of hardship and suffering as Christ did, knowing that after such suffering comes the crown of life (v. 4). This passage underscores the idea that genuine exaltation, or elevation in status or standing, comes as a result of humility, service, and enduring hardships willingly, following Christ's example.

Philippians 2:9-11 further expands on this concept by recounting the story of Jesus Christ. It says that Jesus, though He was in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped at, but emptied Himself, taking on the form of a servant and being made in human likeness (v. 6-7). Through His humility, obedience, and sacrifice on the cross, God highly exalted Jesus and gave Him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father (vv. 9-11). This passage illustrates that exaltation in the Christian faith comes through humility, obedience, and selfless service, ultimately resulting in divine honor and recognition as Lord.

In summary, both passages emphasize the idea that true exaltation within the Christian faith is achieved by following Christ's example of humility and service, enduring hardships willingly, and recognizing that any elevation or glory comes from God, not oneself.
