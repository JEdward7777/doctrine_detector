  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of how specific Scriptural references, including Philippians 2:15, 1 Thessalonians 3:13, and Titus 2:7-8, support the concept of leading a blameless life as a Christian. It effectively connects the verses to the idea of living virtuously, working diligently, and demonstrating integrity as key aspects of maintaining a blameless character. The response could be strengthened by including the additional references provided in the answer and deepening the analysis of each passage's significance in guiding a Christian's life."
