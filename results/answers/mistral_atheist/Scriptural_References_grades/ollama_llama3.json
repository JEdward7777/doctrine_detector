  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response is generally accurate, correctly identifying Genesis as the book containing the reference to God being referred to as \"Almighty\" (El-Shaddai) in relation to Abraham, and providing a specific verse (Genesis 17:1) to support this claim. The response also provides some context about the significance of El-Shaddai in Genesis.\n\nHowever, the response is not entirely comprehensive, as it does not fully explore the implications of God being referred to as \"Almighty\" in this context. Additionally, while the response does provide a specific verse, it could be improved by including more biblical references or additional context to further illustrate the significance of El-Shaddai.\n\nIn terms of addressing the concern about knowing biblical references helping deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises, this response demonstrates some understanding of the importance of biblical knowledge. However, it could be strengthened by exploring how this specific reference deepens our connection to God and His promises.\n\nOverall, while the response is a good start, it could be improved with more detail and exploration of the implications and significance of El-Shaddai in Genesis."
