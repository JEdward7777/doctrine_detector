## Question [Scriptural References](../../../questions/Scriptural_References.md)
Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

## Stated Concern
Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The book that contains the reference to God being referred to as "Almighty" (El-Shaddai) in relation to Abraham is Genesis, specifically in Chapter 17. Here is a specific verse:

Genesis 17:1 - "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, 'I am El-Shaddaiâ€”'God Almighty.' Walk before me faithfully and you will be blameless." (New International Version)

El-Shaddai is a unique name of God in Genesis that signifies God as all-sufficient and mighty, often translated as "Almighty God" or "God of the mountains" in various translations. It's significant here because it appears for the first time during God's covenant with Abraham, emphasizing the divine promise and power associated with it.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response is generally accurate, correctly identifying Genesis as the book containing the reference to God being referred to as "Almighty" (El-Shaddai) in relation to Abraham, and providing a specific verse (Genesis 17:1) to support this claim. The response also provides some context about the significance of El-Shaddai in Genesis.

However, the response is not entirely comprehensive, as it does not fully explore the implications of God being referred to as "Almighty" in this context. Additionally, while the response does provide a specific verse, it could be improved by including more biblical references or additional context to further illustrate the significance of El-Shaddai.

In terms of addressing the concern about knowing biblical references helping deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises, this response demonstrates some understanding of the importance of biblical knowledge. However, it could be strengthened by exploring how this specific reference deepens our connection to God and His promises.

Overall, while the response is a good start, it could be improved with more detail and exploration of the implications and significance of El-Shaddai in Genesis.
