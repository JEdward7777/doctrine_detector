## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The book that contains the reference to God being referred to as "Almighty" (El-Shaddai) in relation to Abraham is Genesis, specifically in Chapter 17. Here is a specific verse:

Genesis 17:1 - "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, 'I am El-Shaddaiâ€”'God Almighty.' Walk before me faithfully and you will be blameless." (New International Version)

El-Shaddai is a unique name of God in Genesis that signifies God as all-sufficient and mighty, often translated as "Almighty God" or "God of the mountains" in various translations. It's significant here because it appears for the first time during God's covenant with Abraham, emphasizing the divine promise and power associated with it.
