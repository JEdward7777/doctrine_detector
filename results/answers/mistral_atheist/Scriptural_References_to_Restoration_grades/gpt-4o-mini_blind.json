The connections drawn between the passages and the theme of restoration are clear and supported by doctrinal correctness. The inclusion of both Old Testament prophecies and New Testament teachings on restoration enriches the depth of the answer. Great job in capturing the essence of God's desire for reconciliation and renewal with humanity."
