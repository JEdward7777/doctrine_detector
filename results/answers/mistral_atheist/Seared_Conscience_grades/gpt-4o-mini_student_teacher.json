  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the concept of a seared conscience, including its implications for believers. They correctly identify the hardening and insensitivity towards sin that characterizes a seared conscience. The response effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the state of one's conscience for spiritual vigilance and integrity. However, the student could improve by more directly referencing the provided answer from the teacher and focusing on succinctly aligning their response with that specific biblical definition."
