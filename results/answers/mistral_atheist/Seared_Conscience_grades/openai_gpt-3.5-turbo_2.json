The explanation is thorough, well-supported with biblical references, and highlights the significance of repentance and God's grace in addressing this issue. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the need for ongoing self-reflection and reliance on the Holy Spirit to maintain a sensitive conscience in daily living."
