  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and informative answer that delves into the historical and cultural context of the term \"Son of Man\" and its implications. However, the answer lacks a clear Christian worldview perspective and fails to emphasize the important doctrinal aspects related to Jesus' statement. A stronger emphasis on the theological significance of the Second Coming of Christ for believers within Christian doctrine would have improved the overall grade."
