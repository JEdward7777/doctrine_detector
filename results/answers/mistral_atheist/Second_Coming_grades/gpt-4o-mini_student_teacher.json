  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the historical and cultural context surrounding the term \"Son of Man\" and its significance in Christian theology. However, the answer lacks a clear focus on the implications of Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man' for Christian hope and eschatology, which was the specific concern raised. The response touches on the topic but does not delve deeply into how this belief influences believers' outlook on the future. Additionally, the answer could have been strengthened by a more explicit connection between the significance of Jesus' return and the hope and eschatological beliefs of Christians."
