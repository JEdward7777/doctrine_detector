It highlights the significance of this belief in affirming hope in Jesus' ultimate authority and the fulfillment of God's promises, aligning well with a Christian worldview. The historical and cultural perspective provided enriches the understanding of the context in which Jesus used the title 'Son of Man.' The only room for improvement would be to more explicitly tie in the core Christian belief in the Second Coming as a source of hope and assurance for believers, but overall, this response demonstrates a solid understanding from a Christian worldview."
