It addresses the concern by exploring the implications of Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man' for Christian hope and eschatology, highlighting the belief in His ultimate authority and the fulfillment of God's promises. The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview but could have delved deeper into specific biblical references and theological interpretations to enhance the analysis further."
