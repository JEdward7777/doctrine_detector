## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The Pharisees, as a strict and conservative Jewish sect during the Second Temple Period (approximately 516 BCE to 70 CE), focused on maintaining the purity of Judaism through adherence to oral traditions that complemented the written Torah. They were primarily concerned with preserving their cultural identity and religious practices amidst the growing influence of Hellenistic culture, which was pervasive in Palestine during the Greco-Roman era.

The Pharisees saw the Gentiles as a potential threat to Jewish tradition because they followed different customs and beliefs, which could lead to syncretism or the blending of religious practices. In their view, such intermingling would compromise the integrity of Judaism and ultimately undermine the special covenant between God and His chosen people. The Pharisees' concern for separation was driven by a desire to preserve Jewish identity, tradition, and faith during this period of cultural upheaval.

Their teachings emphasized meticulous adherence to dietary laws, Sabbath observances, and other religious customs, which they believed set the Jewish people apart from Gentiles. By keeping these traditions, the Pharisees hoped to maintain a clear distinction between their community and the larger Hellenistic world, thereby strengthening their connection to God and preserving the Jewish way of life.

In summary, the Pharisees were concerned about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles because they believed that maintaining distinct cultural and religious identities would help preserve their unique relationship with God and ensure the survival of their community amidst the challenges posed by Hellenistic culture during the Greco-Roman era.
