  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed answer that aligns well with Christian teachings on ministry and service to God. They accurately referenced various biblical passages and highlighted actionable ways for Christians to engage in ministry. The inclusion of specific examples and practical applications demonstrates a strong understanding of how Christians can live out their faith. However, the response could have more directly addressed the teacher's reference answer by explicitly mentioning teaching others about God, caring for the sick, providing for the poor, and fulfilling specific ministry roles. Overall, a commendable and insightful response."
