## [Answer](../Sign_as_Covenant.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Genesis, the rainbow is presented as a symbol of God's covenant with humanity following the Great Flood. According to the Biblical narrative, after the flood subsided and Noah released a raven and a dove, finding that the earth was dry, God made a covenant with Noah and all living creatures:

> "And I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you. And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every kind shall you bring into the ark, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. Of the birds after their kind, and of the animals after their kind, of every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, two of every kind shall you bring into the ark with you to keep them alive. And also of all your food supplies, provision for yourself and them, you shall gather seven days; and on the seventh day, the floodwaters shall cover the earth." (Genesis 6:18-20)

God further states that he will never again curse the ground because of man, and that there will be a sign in the sky for all time to remind him of this covenant:

> "And I establish my covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth." (Genesis 9:11)

This sign is described as a rainbow:

> "I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the cloud, I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life." (Genesis 9:13-15)

So, in this biblical context, the rainbow serves as a reminder of God's promise never to destroy all life by a flood again. The rainbow symbolizes God's mercy and His commitment to protect humanity and the Earth.
