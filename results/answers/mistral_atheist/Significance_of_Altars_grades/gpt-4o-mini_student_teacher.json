  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the significance of altars in ancient Israelite worship, they could have emphasized more explicitly the connection to the concept of sacrifice and devotion. Additionally, they included relevant biblical references to support their points, which is commendable. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the importance of altars in biblical worship."
