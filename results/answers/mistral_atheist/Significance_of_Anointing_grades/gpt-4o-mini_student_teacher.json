  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of anointing in the context of Old Testament priests, kings, and prophets. They accurately highlight the symbolic nature of anointing as a means of consecration, inauguration, and divine approval for specific roles. The student also effectively differentiates between the anointing of priests, kings, and prophets, showcasing a good understanding of the distinct roles and practices. Overall, the response aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher, but could have further emphasized the idea of being set apart for special service to God and the empowerment that comes with anointing."
