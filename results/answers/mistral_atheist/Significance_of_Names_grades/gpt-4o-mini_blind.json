  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a solid explanation of the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name in Bible translations, highlighting its cultural and theological implications within the ancient Near Eastern context. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the historical and religious background surrounding the use of 'Shaddai'. However, there could be a more explicit connection made to how the title 'Shaddai' reflects aspects of God's character and attributes, particularly in contrast to the fertility and abundance associations of other gods in the region. Additionally, integrating scriptural references or theological insights from Christian doctrine could enhance the depth of the response."
