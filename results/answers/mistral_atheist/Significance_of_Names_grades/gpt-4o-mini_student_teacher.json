  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name in Bible translations within the context of ancient Near Eastern religions and cultural frameworks. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith, as the concern specified. The answer focused more on the cultural and theological significance rather than on God's attributes and relational aspect, as highlighted in the reference answer."
