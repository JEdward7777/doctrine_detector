  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name in Bible translations, emphasizing God's attributes in the context of ancient Near Eastern religions and cultural frameworks. It effectively deepens the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith by highlighting how the title 'Shaddai' reflects God's omnipotence and strength, while also recognizing the importance of a personal relationship with Him. The response effectively integrates Christian beliefs and worldview into the discussion."
