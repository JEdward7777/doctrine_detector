  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name within the context of ancient Near Eastern religions and cultural frameworks. It effectively discusses how using 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes of power and faithfulness, contributing to a deeper understanding of His character. The response links this understanding to the relational aspect in the Christian faith by highlighting the distinction between emphasizing God's attributes and fostering a personal relationship with Him. Overall, the response aligns well with the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith."
