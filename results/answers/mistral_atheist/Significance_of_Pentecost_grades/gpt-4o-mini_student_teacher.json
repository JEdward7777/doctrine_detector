  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the significance of the Day of Pentecost in the New Testament, focusing on its role in establishing the Christian church and enabling effective communication among diverse cultures. However, the student missed addressing the specific concern regarding the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers. The reference answer highlights the empowerment of believers through the Holy Spirit for ministry, which was not explicitly addressed in the student's response. It is important to connect the significance of Pentecost directly to the work and presence of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers for a comprehensive Christian worldview perspective."
