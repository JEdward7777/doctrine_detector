It effectively addresses the concern regarding the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers by highlighting how the Holy Spirit enabled the disciples to fulfill their mission and spread the teachings of Jesus Christ. The response could further strengthen its Christian worldview by explicitly acknowledging the Holy Spirit as a key aspect of God's presence and guidance in believers' lives, beyond just empowerment for ministry."
