  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of the symbolism of unleavened bread in the context of Judaism and Christianity, highlighting its significance during Passover and its connection to removing sin. However, the student's answer would benefit from explicitly connecting the symbolism of unleavened bread to living a life that honors God, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the spiritual significance of unleavened bread, but could further enhance the clarity and emphasis on aligning one's life with God's will."
