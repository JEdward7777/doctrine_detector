 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations, but I can help explain the traditional interpretations of symbols based on historical and cultural contexts. In the context of Judaism and Christianity, unleavened bread (also known as matzo) is a significant symbol during Passover, which commemorates the Exodus from Egypt.

The unleavened bread symbolizes the haste with which the Israelites left Egypt. Leaven or yeast was associated with the old life of slavery in Egypt and was to be avoided during Passover. In this context, eating unleavened bread is a way for people to remove leaven (and by extension, sin) from their homes and lives, symbolizing a new start and a fresh commitment to living according to God's laws.

However, it's essential to remember that interpretations can vary among different religious communities, and the symbolism of unleavened bread may take on additional meanings in specific contexts.
