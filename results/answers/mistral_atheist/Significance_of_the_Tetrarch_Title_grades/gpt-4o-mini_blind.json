It correctly connects the term to the Roman influence in the Middle East and explains its role in delegating authority to regional rulers like Herod Antipas. The response could have been strengthened by emphasizing the implications of this governance structure on the interactions between Roman, Tetrarchal, and Jewish authorities, as well as highlighting the specific power dynamics at play. Overall, a solid and informative answer."
