# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The title "Tetrarch" provides insight into the political structure during the time of Jesus, specifically within regions under Roman influence in the Middle East. A Tetrarch was a regional ruler with jurisdiction over one of the four quadrants (tetra means 'four' and archÄ“ meaning 'ruler' or 'governor') of a larger province. The term was used primarily for Herodian dynasty members who ruled territories within the Roman Empire, such as Herod Antipas, the Tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, where Jesus spent much of his ministry. This system reflects the Roman strategy of dividing and ruling, allowing them to maintain control while granting some autonomy to local rulers like the Tetrarchs. The Jewish population under their rule was subject to both Roman and Tetrarchal rule, a complex and often contentious relationship that contributed to the political and religious tensions during Jesus' time.
