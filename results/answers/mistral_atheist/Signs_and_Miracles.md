## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an atheistic scholar, I don't personally hold a belief in God or divine intervention, including the miraculous events attributed to Jesus and the apostles. However, it is important to understand these concepts within their historical and cultural contexts, particularly when examining religious texts such as the New Testament.

Signs and miracles, as described in the Bible, played a significant role in validating the teachings of Jesus and the apostles to their contemporary audiences. They were seen as tangible evidence of divine authority and the truth of the message being shared. In a society where oral tradition was more prevalent than written documentation, and people relied heavily on personal experience for validation, these extraordinary events served as powerful demonstrations of the authenticity of the message.

That being said, it's crucial to approach these accounts with a critical mindset. Many scholars argue that these miraculous tales were not intended to be taken literally but rather as allegorical or metaphorical expressions meant to convey deeper spiritual truths. Furthermore, the stories themselves have undergone various interpretations and reinterpretations over centuries, making it challenging to determine their original purpose or historical accuracy.

In the modern world, where empirical evidence is paramount in establishing truth, signs and miracles would hold little value in proving the veracity of religious claims. Instead, the focus has shifted towards philosophical and ethical arguments for or against the existence of God, as well as the examination of religious texts from a historical, literary, and sociological perspective.

Ultimately, the role signs and miracles played in validating the truth of God's message among early followers serves as an important reminder of how cultural context shapes our understanding of religious beliefs and practices. However, for those who do not share these beliefs, it is essential to approach such concepts with a critical eye and recognize their historical significance without endorsing them as empirical evidence.
