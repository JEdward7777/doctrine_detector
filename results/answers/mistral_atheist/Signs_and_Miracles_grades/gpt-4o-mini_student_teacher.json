  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the historical and cultural factors surrounding signs and miracles in the context of Jesus and the apostles. However, as an atheistic scholar, the student's perspective lacks a Christian worldview that views signs and miracles as manifestations of God's power and authority confirming His message. The student's remarks on the allegorical or metaphorical interpretations of miracles and the focus on empirical evidence show a secular bias. Encouraging critical analysis is commendable, but a stronger acknowledgment of the significance of signs and miracles within a Christian perspective would have been beneficial."
