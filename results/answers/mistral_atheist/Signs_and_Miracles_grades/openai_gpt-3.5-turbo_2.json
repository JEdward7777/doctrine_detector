The explanation of how signs and miracles were viewed in biblical times adds depth to the analysis. The acknowledgment of differing scholarly interpretations and the importance of critical thinking is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview, the absence of acknowledgment of faith as a crucial element in perceiving signs and miracles in God's revelation could have been addressed more directly. Integrating the concept of faith as a key component in understanding the relationship between signs, miracles, and God's revelation would have strengthened the connection to the specified concern."
