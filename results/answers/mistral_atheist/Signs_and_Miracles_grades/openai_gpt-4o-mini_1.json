The atheistic perspective hinders a full appreciation of the spiritual significance of signs and miracles as manifestations of God's power and presence. Additionally, the focus on historical, cultural, and critical interpretations overlooks the foundational aspect of faith in understanding the role of signs and miracles in God's revelation."
