However, as an atheistic scholar, the response lacks a Christian worldview perspective on the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. It provides a well-reasoned analysis and acknowledges differing scholarly interpretations, but a deeper engagement with the Christian understanding of faith and the supernatural nature of signs and miracles would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
