## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar, I am committed to providing historically accurate and culturally respectful responses. In the context of Christianity, the titles "Son of God" and "sons (or children) of God" hold significant theological differences, rooted in the specific narratives and interpretations within the Christian tradition.

In the New Testament, the title "Son of God" is primarily used to refer to Jesus Christ, as it appears numerous times in the Gospels. This title carries a unique connotation, emphasizing Jesus's divine nature, his special relationship with God, and his role as Messiah or Savior. The term is employed to underscore the belief that Jesus is not just a human being but also possesses divine attributes.

On the other hand, the term "sons (or children) of God" refers collectively to all believers, emphasizing their spiritual relationship with God and their membership within the Christian community. This title underscores the belief in the inherent dignity and worth of every person as being created in God's image. The relationship between God and His people is one of love, nurture, and adoption rather than biological or divine descent.

Though both titles share a common origin (Genesis 6:2 and Psalm 2:7), the New Testament reinterprets these references in light of the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The title "Son of God" is therefore understood as a unique, special, and singular application, while "sons (or children) of God" is applied to all those who accept Jesus as their Savior and follow his teachings.
