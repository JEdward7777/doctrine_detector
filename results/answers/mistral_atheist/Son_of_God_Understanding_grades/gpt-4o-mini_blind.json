  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a general overview of the term \"Son of God\" in Christian theology but lacks clarity and conviction in presenting the orthodox understanding. The answer mentions different interpretations without clearly affirming the traditional Christian belief in the deity of Christ as the Son of God who is one with the Father in the Trinity. It is important for the response to clearly emphasize the divinity of Jesus Christ as the Son of God, rather than presenting varying viewpoints as equally valid. The answer could benefit from a stronger theological stance rooted in the orthodox Christian understanding of the term."
