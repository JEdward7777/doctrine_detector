  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive overview of the term \"Son of God\" and its interpretations within Christian theology, considering various perspectives and debates. However, the response falls short in affirming the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God the Father as emphasized in the Christian worldview. The student's explanation lacks a clear affirmation of Jesus being fully God and sharing the same nature as God the Father, which is essential in understanding the deeper theological significance of the term \"Son of God\" in Christianity."
