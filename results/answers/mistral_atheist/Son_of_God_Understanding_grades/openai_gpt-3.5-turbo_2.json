  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the term \"Son of God\" within Christian theology, acknowledging the various interpretations and debates surrounding it. However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern regarding the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God. While it mentions the idea of Jesus being fully God and sharing the same nature as God the Father, there is not a direct connection made to the eternal aspect of this relationship. To improve the grade, the response could have emphasized more clearly the eternal and unchanging nature of Jesus' divinity and relationship with God."
