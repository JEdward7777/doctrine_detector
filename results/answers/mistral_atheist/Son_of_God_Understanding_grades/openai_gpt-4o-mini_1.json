  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"Son of God\" within Christian theology, acknowledging the various interpretations and debates surrounding it. It correctly emphasizes the deep religious significance of this term for Christians. However, the response lacks a clear affirmation or rejection of the specific concern regarding the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God, which is key in a Christian worldview. A more direct alignment with the provided answer and concern would strengthen the response."
