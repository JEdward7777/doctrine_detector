However, the response does not explicitly affirm the given answer that Jesus is fully God and shares the same nature as God the Father. To fully address the concern regarding understanding the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God from a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial to clearly assert the belief in Jesus' full divinity as the second person of the Holy Trinity."
