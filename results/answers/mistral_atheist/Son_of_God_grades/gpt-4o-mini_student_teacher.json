  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the distinction between the title 'Son of God' as it applies to Jesus and the term 'sons of God' used for believers within the Christian tradition. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the theological significance and implications of these titles. However, the answer could be improved by providing a more concise and direct distinction, as shown in the reference answer, which would enhance clarity and avoid potential confusion in theological discussions."
