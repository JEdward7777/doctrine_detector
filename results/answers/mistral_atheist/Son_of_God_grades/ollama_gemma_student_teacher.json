The response clearly articulates the unique significance of the former title as applied to Jesus Christ, emphasizing his divine nature and role as Savior, while appropriately distinguishing it from the latter title, which refers to all believers. The historical and theological context is also well-presented, demonstrating a solid grasp of Christian doctrine."
