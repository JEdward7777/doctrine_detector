However, the answer lacks doctrinal clarity from a Christian worldview. It is important to emphasize that the most doctrinally accurate interpretation from a Christian perspective is the understanding of the \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6 as fallen angels, as supported by Jude 6-7 and 2 Peter 2:4-5. The answer should have highlighted this viewpoint as the primary interpretation within Christian theology. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of each interpretation rather than simply presenting them superficially."
