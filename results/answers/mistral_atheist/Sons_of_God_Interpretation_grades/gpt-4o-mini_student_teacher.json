  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the various interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, providing detailed explanations supported by biblical references. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of different perspectives while respecting the cultural and historical contexts of the interpretations. To improve, the student could have engaged further with the primary reference answer provided by the teacher to strengthen the response and align more closely with a Christian worldview interpretation."
