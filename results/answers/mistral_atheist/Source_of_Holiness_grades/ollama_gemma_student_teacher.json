  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately explains the process of becoming a saint in the Christian faith, highlighting the importance of heroic virtue, Church investigation, beatification, canonization, and feast days. However, it lacks emphasis on the central role of faith in sainthood, which is highlighted in the reference answer. Including a brief elaboration on the transformative power of faith would strengthen the student's response and better align it with the specified concern."
