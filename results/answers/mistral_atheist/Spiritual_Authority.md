## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Biblical teaching, spiritual and earthly authorities hold distinct roles and functions. Here's a breakdown of the differences between these two types of authority:

1. Source of Authority: Earthly authorities are appointed by human governments, whereas spiritual authority is given by God. For instance, kings and rulers are often anointed by religious leaders or chosen by popular vote, but spiritual authority comes from God's call (e.g., prophets, priests, and apostles).

2. Scope of Authority: Earthly authorities have jurisdiction over temporal matters, such as laws, governance, and administration. Spiritual authority, on the other hand, concerns religious matters, including moral guidance, interpretations of scripture, and spiritual direction.

3. Relationship with God: Earthly authorities are accountable to their citizens, while spiritual authorities are accountable to God. They serve as intermediaries between people and God and are expected to uphold and teach the word of God.

4. Purpose: Earthly authorities are designed to maintain order, protect the weak, and promote justice on earth. Spiritual authorities help individuals grow in their relationship with God, understand His will, and guide them through life's spiritual journey.

5. Basis for Obedience: Obedience to earthly authorities is based on the social contract or adherence to the law. Obedience to spiritual authorities stems from faith, trust, and belief in their divine appointment and guidance.

6. Eternity vs. Mortality: Earthly authority has a finite lifespan as leaders come and go throughout history. Spiritual authority is often seen as timeless, with the teachings of spiritual leaders passed down through generations.
