  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the differences between spiritual and earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching. The breakdown of their roles, source of authority, relationship with God, purpose, basis for obedience, and eternity vs. mortality is well-explained and aligns with Christian doctrine. However, to improve the grade, the answer could include more scriptural references to support each point and deepen the theological foundation of the explanation. Additionally, emphasizing the ultimate submission to God's authority as the highest authority in both realms would further enhance the answer."
