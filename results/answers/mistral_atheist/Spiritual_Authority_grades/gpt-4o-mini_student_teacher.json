  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 70.\n\nWhile the student's response provides a thorough breakdown of the differences between spiritual and earthly authorities based on Biblical teaching, there is a lack of direct scriptural reference supporting these distinctions. Connecting the explanation to specific Bible verses, like the teacher's reference to Ephesians 6:12, would strengthen the argument from a Christian worldview perspective. Additionally, integrating more biblical examples or parables related to spiritual and earthly authorities could enhance the depth of the analysis. This answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic but could benefit from stronger biblical support.\n\nRemember, grounding responses in scripture is crucial when discussing Christian teachings on authority."
