The connection to Ephesians 6:12 to highlight spiritual authorities exerting power over those who do not submit to God's authority is appropriate and aligns well with the concern of recognizing the distinction between spiritual and worldly authority in a Christian's life. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and effectively relates it to Christian teachings. Great job!"
