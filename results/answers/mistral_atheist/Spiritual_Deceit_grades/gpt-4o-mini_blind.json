  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the role of demons in deception related to idolatry across various religious traditions. The student correctly references biblical accounts in both the Old and New Testaments that illustrate how demons can influence individuals towards idolatry. However, the response lacks emphasis on the Christian worldview that demons are real spiritual entities seeking to lead people away from the worship of the one true God. The student should have also highlighted the importance of spiritual warfare and the need for believers to resist demonic influences through prayer, obedience to God's Word, and reliance on the Holy Spirit. Incorporating these aspects would have strengthened the doctrinal accuracy of the response."
