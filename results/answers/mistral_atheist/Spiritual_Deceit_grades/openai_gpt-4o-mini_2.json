It acknowledges the role of demons in deceiving people into believing in false gods and idols, contrary to the truth of Yahweh as the one true God. The inclusion of biblical references and examples further supports the Christian concern of being aware of spiritual deceit and remaining vigilant against influences that lead believers away from God's sovereignty. However, the response could have strengthened its Christian perspective by emphasizing the need for prayer, reliance on Scripture, and discernment through the Holy Spirit in combating spiritual deception."
