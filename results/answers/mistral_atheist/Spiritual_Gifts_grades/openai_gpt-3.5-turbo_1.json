It recognizes the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and serving others, which aligns well with the concern provided. However, the response could have incorporated more emphasis on the aspect of personal obedience to the Holy Spirit, perhaps by exploring how individuals discern and develop their spiritual gifts in accordance with God's guidance."
