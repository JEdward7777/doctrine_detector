However, it neglects to emphasize the foundational spiritual aspect of confession and healing as outlined in James 5:16. The answer could be enhanced by incorporating a stronger emphasis on the role of God's forgiveness, repentance, and the spiritual cleansing that comes through confession within the context of Christian beliefs. Integrating more scriptural references and theological insights would strengthen the overall response from a Christian worldview perspective."
