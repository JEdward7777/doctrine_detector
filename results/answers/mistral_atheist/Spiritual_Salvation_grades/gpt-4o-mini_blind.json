The mention of being \"born again\" and the different perspectives on salvation within Christian denominations adds depth to the response. However, the answer could have delved deeper into the essential role of faith in salvation and the concept of justification by grace through faith. Additionally, emphasizing the transformative aspect of salvation in a believer's life would have enhanced the response."
