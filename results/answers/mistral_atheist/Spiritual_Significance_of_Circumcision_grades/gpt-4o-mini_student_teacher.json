  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of \"circumcision of the heart\" in a Christian context, referencing relevant Bible verses and emphasizing the transformation of the heart towards spiritual purity and obedience to God. While the student's answer aligned well with the Christian worldview, it lacked a specific emphasis on the role of faith in Jesus Christ as the means of the removal of sin and purification of the heart, as highlighted in the reference answer. Adding this crucial element would have strengthened the student's response further."
