 In a Christian context, the phrase "circumcision of the heart" symbolizes spiritual purity and obedience to God. It is often referenced in the Bible, particularly in Deuteronomy 10:16 and 30:6, where it describes the idea that true circumcision is not just physical but also spiritual. This concept suggests a transformation of the heart from within, resulting in a deeper connection with God, a rejection of sinful behaviors, and a commitment to follow His laws and commandments. It's essential to remember that interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations.
