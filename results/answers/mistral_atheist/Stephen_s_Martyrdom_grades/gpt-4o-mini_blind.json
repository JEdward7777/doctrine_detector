  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer effectively highlights the significance of the stoning of Stephen in the early Christian church, emphasizing its role as an early instance of martyrdom, the intense hostility faced from traditional Jewish authorities, and its foreshadowing of broader societal persecution. The mention of the cultural clash between Christianity and traditional Judaism is also well articulated. The response could be enhanced by further exploration of the theological implications of Stephen's martyrdom in terms of reflecting Christ's suffering and the spread of the Gospel. Overall, a strong and well-written analysis from a Christian worldview."
