  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a well-thought-out response addressing the practice of stoning for adultery in the Old Testament and relating it to God's justice and mercy. They show an understanding of the historical context and complexity of interpreting ancient texts. However, the student could strengthen their answer by emphasizing more explicitly the balance between God's justice and mercy, as seen in the reference answer given by the teacher. Additionally, while the student acknowledges modern Christian interpretations, they could have highlighted Jesus' teachings on mercy and forgiveness more prominently to support their argument. Overall, a strong effort with room for slight improvement in focusing on the concern provided."
