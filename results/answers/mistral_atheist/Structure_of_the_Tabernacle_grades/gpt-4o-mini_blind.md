 In the Biblical account as detailed in the Book of Exodus, the Tabernacle (also known as the Mishkan in Hebrew) was a portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. It consisted of two main sections: the outer courtyard and the inner sanctuary, which were further divided into the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place.

1. Outer Courtyard (Hebrew: הַקּוֹדֶשׁ הָאֶחָת - HaKodesh ha-Echad): This was the outermost area of the Tabernacle, accessible to all Israelites. It contained the Altar of Burnt Offering (Mizbe'ach), where animal sacrifices were offered to God. The bronze Laver (Mikveh) was also located here, used for ritual purification before entering the Holy Place.

2. Inner Sanctuary (Hebrew: הַקּוֹדֶשׁ הָרִבִיעִי - HaKodesh ha-Ribui): This inner section was divided into two areas:
   a. The Holy Place (Décor: Golden Altar of Incense, Seven-branched Menorah, and the Showbread Table): The first chamber housed three main furnishings: the Golden Altar of Incense, where priestly incense was burned daily; the seven-branched menorah, symbolizing God's constant presence and light; and the Showbread Table, with twelve loaves of bread representing God's provision for the people.

   b. The Most Holy Place (Décor: Ark of the Covenant): The innermost sanctum contained the Ark of the Covenant, a chest made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, containing the Tablets of Stone on which the Ten Commandments were inscribed and a golden pot containing Aaron's rod that budded. This area was accessible only to the high priest once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).

Each section played a significant role in the religious practices and daily life of the Israelites, symbolizing their relationship with God during their journey through the wilderness.
