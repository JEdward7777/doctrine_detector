  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the two main sections of the tabernacle, including the Outer Courtyard, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place, along with the specific furnishings contained within each section. The answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of the components of the tabernacle in worship. However, the specific focus on the altar for burning incense in the Holy Place and the ark of the covenant in the Most Holy Place, as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer, was not directly addressed by the student. Overall, a thorough and well-written response."
