  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: This student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the historical and cultural significance of manna within the context of the Israelites' journey in the wilderness. However, the student's atheistic worldview prevented them from recognizing the overarching theme of God's ongoing provision for His people, which is the central focus of the symbolism of manna. While the student's perspective is understandable, it significantly detracts from the Christian-specific understanding of manna as a manifestation of divine care and sustenance."
