  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a comprehensive and well-researched analysis of the symbolic significance of manna in the context of biblical literature. They clearly explain the historical and cultural significance of the concept, while also acknowledging the skeptical perspective of an atheist scholar. However, the grade could be improved by explicitly connecting the symbolism of manna to Christian beliefs about God's ongoing provision for believers."
