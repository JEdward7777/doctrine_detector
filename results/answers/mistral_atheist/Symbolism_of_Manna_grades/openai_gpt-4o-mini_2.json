However, it falls short in recognizing God's ongoing provision for believers as a central aspect of the symbolism of manna. From a Christian worldview, understanding the story of manna solely as a cultural or historical narrative overlooks the deeper spiritual significance of God's continual care for His people. The scholar's atheistic perspective limits the interpretation to more secular and anthropological viewpoints, missing the essential element of divine intervention and provision in the biblical narrative."
