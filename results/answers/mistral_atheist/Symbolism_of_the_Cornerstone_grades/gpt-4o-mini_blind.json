  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and well-explained analysis of how the metaphor of the cornerstone illustrates the relationship between Jesus and His followers within a Christian context. The student effectively connects various aspects of the metaphor to Jesus' role and the implications for believers, demonstrating a strong understanding of the doctrinal significance of the cornerstone imagery in both Old and New Testament contexts. The response could be further strengthened by incorporating more scriptural references and perhaps delving deeper into the theological implications of Jesus being the cornerstone."
