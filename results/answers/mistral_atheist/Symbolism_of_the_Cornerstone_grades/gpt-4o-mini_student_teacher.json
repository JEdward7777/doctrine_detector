  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that effectively addresses the aspects of the metaphor of the cornerstone in illustrating the relationship between Jesus and His followers. The points made by the student align closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher. However, the student could improve by focusing more on the specific concern of how understanding this relationship can help believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example to further strengthen the connection between the metaphor and practical application in the lives of believers."
