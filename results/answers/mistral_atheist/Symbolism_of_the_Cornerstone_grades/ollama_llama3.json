  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of exploring the metaphor of Jesus as the cornerstone in the context of early Christianity, providing a clear and concise explanation of how it relates to Jesus' role and the relationship between Him and His followers. The writer effectively uses biblical references to support their points, including Ephesians 2:20, Psalm 118:22, and Isaiah 28:16.\n\nThe response also addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding this relationship can help believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example. Specifically, it shows how Jesus as the cornerstone provides spiritual guidance, wisdom, and strength to build one's life upon Him, which is in line with the concern.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response could be more concise and focused on the specific concern. Some of the points made are not directly related to the concern, such as the discussion of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. While these details are important, they slightly detract from the main argument being made.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively explores the metaphor of Jesus as the cornerstone and its relevance to believers aligning their lives with Christ's teachings and example."
