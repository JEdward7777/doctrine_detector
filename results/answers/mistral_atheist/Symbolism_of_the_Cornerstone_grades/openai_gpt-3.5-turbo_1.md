# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of early Christianity, the metaphor of the cornerstone, as found in the New Testament (Ephesians 2:20, Psalm 118:22, Isaiah 28:16), is often used to symbolize Jesus' role and the relationship between Him and His followers.

1. Foundation and Support: Just as a cornerstone supports and holds together the entire structure of a building, Jesus is seen as the foundation and source of support for His followers. He provides them with spiritual guidance, wisdom, and strength to build their lives upon.

2. Centrality and Importance: The cornerstone is traditionally the first stone laid in the construction of a building, often the most significant one. Similarly, Jesus is considered central to Christianity as the key figure around whom the faith revolves. He is seen as the most important person in Christian teachings and history.

3. Rejection and Acceptance: In the Old Testament (Isaiah 28:16), the cornerstone is a stone that was rejected by builders because it was considered too large or irregularly shaped. Yet, it ultimately became the foundation of the structure. This parallels Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, as He was initially rejected but later accepted and revered by His followers and countless others throughout history.

4. Unity: The cornerstone connects different parts of a building, ensuring their structural integrity and unity. Similarly, Jesus brings unity to His followers, connecting them through faith in Him and His teachings. This unity is not only spiritual but also social, as it has often united diverse groups of people throughout history.

5. Salvation: In the New Testament (Ephesians 2:20), the apostle Paul uses this metaphor to explain how Gentiles are being grafted into the House of Israel and become part of God's larger family through faith in Jesus, just as a building is constructed using various stones. This illustrates the idea that accepting Jesus as the cornerstone leads to salvation and unity with others who do the same.
