  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the significance of using a lamb for sacrifices in the Bible and its relation to atonement. They effectively explore the biblical narratives and rituals involving lambs, and connect them to the concept of atonement in both the Old and New Testaments. The student's response demonstrates a deep understanding of the symbolism and theological implications of the sacrificial system with regards to atonement. The only area for improvement would be to directly address the simplicity and directness of the reference answer, which emphasizes the innocence of the lamb as a key aspect of atonement."
