The integration of Old Testament references, such as the story of Abraham and Isaac, the Passover sacrifice, and the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus, was well done. Additionally, the connection between the sacrificial lamb in the Old Testament and Jesus as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb in the New Testament was effectively made. The response could have further strengthened the Christian perspective by explicitly highlighting Jesus as the fulfillment of these sacrificial practices in the Old Testament."
