## [Answer](../Synagogue_Beliefs.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In a broader, cultural context, the term 'synagogue' extends beyond merely referring to a physical structure. It can also refer to the Jewish community as a whole or the spiritual and social gathering of Jews for prayer, study, and communal activities. This usage emphasizes the collective, shared religious identity and practices among Jews. Additionally, synagogue may symbolize the Jewish way of life, including their traditions, rituals, history, and values. In this sense, a synagogue is not just a building but a cultural institution that embodies the unique aspects of Judaism.
