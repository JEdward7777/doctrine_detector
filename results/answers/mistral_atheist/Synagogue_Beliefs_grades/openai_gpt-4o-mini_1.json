It effectively demonstrates an understanding of the communal significance and spiritual gathering represented by the term 'synagogue' in Judaism from a Christian worldview perspective. The response could have blended in a bit more of a Christian-specific viewpoint or referenced the scriptural importance of community worship, but overall it addresses the concern satisfactorily."
