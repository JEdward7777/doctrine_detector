The mention of the temple being a place for sacrificial rituals, prayer, and housing the Ark of the Covenant shows a solid understanding of its functions. However, from a Christian perspective, it would be important to emphasize that the Temple foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ and served as a type or shadow of the New Covenant. Additionally, referencing the importance of Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of the temple's purpose would enrich the answer theologically."
