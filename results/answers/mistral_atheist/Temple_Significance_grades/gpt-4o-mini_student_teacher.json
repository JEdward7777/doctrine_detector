  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-informed answer that demonstrates a deep understanding of the role and significance of the Temple in Old Testament worship. They effectively highlighted the various functions of the Temple and its importance as a place for communal worship and symbolic representation of the covenant between God and Israel. However, the answer could have been more explicitly tied back to the reference answer provided by the teacher, focusing more directly on the primary purpose of the Temple as a place of worship and sacrifice."
