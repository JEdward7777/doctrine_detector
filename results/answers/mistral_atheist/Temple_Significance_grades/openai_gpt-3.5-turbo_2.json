It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the multiple functions of the Temple beyond just being a place of worship and sacrifice, emphasizing its role in Old Testament worship. The only minor suggestion would be to explicitly mention the covenantal aspect of the Temple in relation to God's presence among His people, which is a crucial theme in understanding its importance."
