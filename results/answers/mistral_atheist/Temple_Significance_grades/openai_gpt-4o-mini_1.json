  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and insightful analysis of the role of the Temple in ancient Israel, drawing from historical, cultural, and biblical perspectives. It effectively addresses the concern by contextualizing the Temple within the framework of Old Testament worship. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie the response back to the central claim that the Temple was built as a place of worship and sacrifice for Israelites to connect with God."
