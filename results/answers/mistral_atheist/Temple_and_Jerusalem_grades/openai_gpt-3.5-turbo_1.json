The answer effectively addresses the concern by exploring how Zion became associated with the temple due to its prominence in Jerusalem. The response could further enhance its Christian worldview perspective by emphasizing the spiritual significance of Zion in connection with God's presence and redemption, as seen in passages such as Psalm 48:2 and Hebrews 12:22."
