## [Answer](../Temple_and_Jerusalem.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The term "Zion" has a long and complex history, dating back to the ancient Hebrew Bible (Tanakh). In its earliest usage, Zion refers to a specific hill or mountain in Jerusalem that was considered sacred due to its association with the Jebusite city, which later became part of the Kingdom of David.

The term's significance evolved throughout the Jewish scriptures. For instance, in Psalm 87, Zion is personified as a mother who gathers the tribes of Israel together. In Isaiah 40:9-11, Zion represents the city that will not be destroyed but will remain forever and be called "The Holy City."

When the Second Temple was rebuilt by the Jews after their return from Babylonian captivity (538 BCE), it was built on Mount Moriah, which is also known as Mount Zion. Therefore, the term "Zion" became associated with the temple located in Jerusalem, symbolizing the sacred city and the heart of the Jewish people.

In later Jewish tradition, the term Zion continued to be used metaphorically to represent the idealized version of Jerusalem or the Jewish homeland. In Christianity, it often refers to the heavenly realm or the spiritual church (see Revelation 14:1). Today, "Zion" is most commonly associated with the State of Israel and the city of Jerusalem, representing the cultural, religious, and historical center of Judaism.
