  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of God's dwelling among His people in both the Old and New Testaments. They correctly describe the physical temple in the Old Testament and the believers as the temple of God in the New Testament. The student effectively connects the theological implications of God dwelling among His people, demonstrating a clear understanding of the significance of this concept within Christianity. However, they could have strengthened their argument by incorporating more direct biblical references to support their points. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
