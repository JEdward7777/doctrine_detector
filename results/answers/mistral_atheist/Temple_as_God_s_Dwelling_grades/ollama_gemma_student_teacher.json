  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling place in both the Old and New Testaments. It clearly explains the physical temple in the Old Testament and its significance as the dwelling place of Yahweh, as well as the shift in the New Testament where believers are referred to as the 'temple of the Holy Spirit'. The answer is well-organized and demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the theological implications of God dwelling among His people."
