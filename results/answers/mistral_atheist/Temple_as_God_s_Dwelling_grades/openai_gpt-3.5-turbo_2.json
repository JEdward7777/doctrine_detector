The connection between the physical temple and the community of believers as God's dwelling place is well articulated, showcasing a solid understanding of this theological concept within the Christian worldview. However, there could have been a bit more depth in discussing the significance and impact of this shift in God's dwelling place from the physical temple to believers in Jesus."
