 In the Old Testament, the temple is presented as the physical dwelling place of Yahweh among his people Israel. The first temple was built by King Solomon around 1000 BCE according to the Hebrew Bible (1 Kings 6-7), and the second temple was rebuilt after the Babylonian exile in the 6th century BCE. The temple is described as a place where God's presence dwells among his people, and it serves as the center of religious life and national identity for the Israelites (Exodus 25:8; Deuteronomy 12:5).

In the New Testament, Jesus and his followers do not have a physical temple to worship in, as the second temple had been destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. However, they understand themselves to be the true temple of God (John 2:19-21; Ephesians 2:19-22). In this sense, the temple is no longer a physical building but rather the community of believers who gather together to worship and follow Jesus. This idea is also reflected in the prophecies of the Old Testament, such as Isaiah 56:7, which speaks of strangers joining themselves to the Lord and serving him, "and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for I will give them a name better than sons and daughters, I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off."

Overall, the concept of the temple as God's dwelling place is a central theme in both the Old and New Testaments. In the Old Testament, it is expressed through the physical temple, while in the New Testament, it is expressed through the community of believers who gather together to worship and follow Jesus.

Comment: The response effectively explores the theological implications of God dwelling among His people by highlighting the transition from the physical temple in the Old Testament to believers being considered the temple of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. The comparison between the Old Testament temple and the community of believers in the New Testament provides a comprehensive understanding of this theological concept.
