  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of Jesus' response to the temptations presented by Satan as recorded in the Gospel accounts. The student effectively highlights the three temptations and Jesus' scriptural responses, emphasizing the importance of faithfulness to God and reliance on His word. The only aspect that could have enhanced the response further is a deeper exploration of the significance of these temptations within the broader theological context of Jesus' mission and the battle against evil."
