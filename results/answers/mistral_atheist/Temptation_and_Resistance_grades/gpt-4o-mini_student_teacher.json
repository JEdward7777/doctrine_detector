  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and accurate explanation of Jesus' responses to the temptations presented by Satan, referencing the relevant biblical passages and highlighting the importance of Jesus' faithfulness and reliance on God's word. The answer effectively connects Jesus' actions to a model for Christian believers to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil. However, it could have been improved by directly stating that Jesus did not give in to the temptations, as mentioned in the reference answer provided."
