  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Comprehensive and well-researched response that lists various terms used in Christian communities to refer to the Lord's Supper.\n* Provides definitions and explanations for each term, highlighting the cultural, denominational, and regional variations in terminology.\n* Includes references to relevant passages from the New Testament.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Does not address the specific concern of the given question, which is to highlight the terms 'communion' and 'Last Supper'.\n* The grade could be improved by elaborating on the significance of these two terms within Christianity.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe student has demonstrated a thorough understanding of the different terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper in Christian communities. However, addressing the specific concern of the question would have elevated the quality of the response."
