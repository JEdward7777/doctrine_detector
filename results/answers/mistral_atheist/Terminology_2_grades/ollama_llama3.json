  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThis response only mentions two terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper, which is insufficient in addressing the concern of understanding various terms used within Christianity. The provided list includes nine different terms used by Christian communities, and the student's response does not demonstrate an awareness or understanding of these terms. To fully address the concern, a more comprehensive response that includes multiple terms would be necessary.\n\nComment: This response shows a lack of depth and understanding of the various terms used within Christianity to refer to the Lord's Supper."
