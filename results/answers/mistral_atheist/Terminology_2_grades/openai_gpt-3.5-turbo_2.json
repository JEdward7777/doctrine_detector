  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the broad range of terms used within Christianity to refer to the Lord's Supper, going beyond just the terms \"communion\" and \"Last Supper\" mentioned in the original answer. The inclusion of various terms from different Christian traditions enriches the response and shows a comprehensive understanding of the topic. The response could have provided more insight into the significance and theological implications behind each term, but overall it shows a strong grasp of the concern at hand."
