 In Christian communities, the Lord's Supper is known by various terms that reflect cultural, denominational, and regional differences:

1. Eucharist (Greek for thanksgiving) - This term is commonly used in Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and some Anglican churches.
2. Holy Communion - This phrase is used widely across many denominations including the Anglican Church, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, and others. It emphasizes the sacred nature of the event.
3. The Sacrament of the Altar - This term is frequently used in Lutheran churches, highlighting its sacramental aspect.
4. Mass - In Roman Catholic and some Anglican traditions, this term is often used to refer to a communion service that includes a Eucharistic celebration (the Liturgy of the Eucharist).
5. Agape Feast or Love Feast - This term comes from early Christian gatherings in the New Testament. Some denominations like the United Pentecostal Church and Oneness Pentecostals use this term to emphasize love, fellowship, and the communion meal as a demonstration of the shared life of believers in Christ.
6. Breaking of Bread - This phrase is found in the New Testament (Acts 20:7) and is used by some churches, such as Churches of Christ and independent Bible churches, to emphasize the importance of communion as a memorial of Christ's death.
7. The Lord's Table or Communion Table - These terms are often used to refer to the table upon which the elements of bread and wine (or grape juice) are placed for distribution during the service.
8. Holy Mysteries or Sacraments - Used by some Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Catholic Churches to emphasize the sacredness and mystery of the event.
9. Divine Liturgy - In some Eastern Orthodox churches, the term "Divine Liturgy" refers to their communion service, with each church having its own particular liturgy (e.g., the Byzantine Rite, the Russian Rite, and others).
