  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of alternative terms that can be used to describe a deacon, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the various ways to identify service roles within the church. The inclusion of terms like \"Servant Leader\" and \"Diakonos (Greek)\" shows a deep appreciation for the Biblical roots and servant-hearted nature of the deacon's role. However, the reference answer from the teacher offers a more concise and straightforward list of alternative terms that align closely with traditional terminology. Overall, the student's answer is well-researched and thoughtfully presented."
