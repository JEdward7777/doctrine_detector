  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response recognizes that there are different ways to identify service roles within the church, which addresses the concern. However, it does not provide a comprehensive or detailed explanation of the various terms used to describe deacons or their roles. The answer is somewhat vague and general, only mentioning three possible names for a deacon without providing any insight into what these titles entail or how they are distinct from one another.\n\nTo improve this response, the writer could have provided more specific information about each term, such as its biblical roots, historical context, or current usage in different denominations. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic and provide more value to readers seeking to understand the various service roles within the church."
