  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively demonstrates an understanding of the various ways to identify service roles within the church by providing a comprehensive list of terms commonly used to describe individuals serving in ecclesiastical capacities. It also successfully connects these terms to the broader concept of a deacon being referred to as a church minister, worker, or servant. The inclusion of the term \"Diakonos\" and its significance from the New Testament adds depth to the response. Overall, a well-rounded and informative answer that aligns with recognizing the diverse terminology related to service roles within the church from a Christian worldview."
