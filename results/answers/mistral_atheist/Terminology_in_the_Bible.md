1. Israelites: The descendants of Jacob (also called Israel) who were enslaved in Egypt and later led out by Moses. They were the original recipients of the covenant with God and were often referred to as God's chosen people.

2. Jews: A term that originated from the tribes of Judah and Joseph, it eventually came to be used to refer to all descendants of the Israelites who lived in the kingdom of Judah. Today, it is primarily used to refer to adherents of Judaism.

3. Hebrews: This term was originally used by ancient Egyptians to refer to the people who spoke the Hebrew language, which was the language of the Israelites. It is less commonly used today, but in the Bible, it is often used interchangeably with "Israelites" or "Jews".

These three terms are often used throughout the Old Testament to describe God's chosen people, who were promised a special relationship with Him and a land of their own. However, it's important to note that usage and definitions can vary based on cultural context and historical period.
