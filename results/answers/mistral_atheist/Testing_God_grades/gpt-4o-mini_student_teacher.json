  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation on why testing God is considered inappropriate from various perspectives. However, the response lacks a clear focus on the Christian perspective and the specific concern given. It touches on theological, ethical, and cultural considerations in a general sense, but does not directly address the importance of maintaining a proper relationship with God within a Christian worldview. Encouraging the student to provide a more targeted and Christian-specific response in alignment with the given concern would improve the grade."
