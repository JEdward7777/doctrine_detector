  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-articulated explanation showcasing the differences between testing and temptation in a biblical context. They accurately highlight that testing is often initiated by God for the purpose of strengthening faith, while temptation is linked to the devil's attempts to lead individuals astray. The student effectively captures the essence of both concepts and their ultimate aim of either enhancing faith or challenging one's moral character. The response could be enhanced by incorporating more specific biblical references to support their points further."
