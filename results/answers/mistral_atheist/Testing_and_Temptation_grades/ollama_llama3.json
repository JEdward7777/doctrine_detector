While it may not fully align with the provided answer or concern, it demonstrates a good understanding of the scriptural context and application.\n\nThe response's strength lies in its ability to provide concrete examples from Scripture (Genesis 22 and Matthew 4) to illustrate the differences between testing and temptation. It also acknowledges the ultimate purpose of both concepts: strengthening one's faith. The only area for improvement is in more explicitly addressing the concern about differentiating between testing and temptation for spiritual discernment.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a solid grasp of biblical truths and their application to spiritual growth, earning an 85 out of 100."
