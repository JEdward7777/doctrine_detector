It acknowledges the importance of spiritual discernment in understanding these concepts accurately. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning that God does not tempt individuals, as this could further emphasize the role of God's sovereignty in testing versus temptation. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
