## [Answer](../Tetrarch_Role_in_the_New_Testament.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 Herod Antipas, also known as "Herod the Tetrarch," plays a notable role in the New Testament, particularly in the accounts of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. He was the ruler of Galilee and Perea (also called the tetrarchy of Herod Antipas) from 4 BCE to 39 CE.

One of the most significant events related to Herod Antipas in the New Testament is the story of John the Baptist. John, a Jewish prophet, preached repentance and baptized people in the Jordan River as part of his mission to prepare the way for the Messiah. However, he criticized the morals of King Herod Antipas, who was married to Herodias, the former wife (or sister, according to some accounts) of his brother Herod II.

Enraged by John's criticism, Antipas ordered the prophet's arrest and imprisonment. Later, during a feast in honor of his birthday, Salome, daughter of Herodias, danced before Antipas and his guests. In response to her mother's wishes, Antipas promised to give Salome whatever she asked for. She asked for the head of John the Baptist on a platter, and the king fulfilled the request despite feeling remorse (Matthew 14:1-12; Mark 6:17-29; Luke 3:19-20; 9:7-9).

Another significant event involving Herod Antipas is the trial and execution of Jesus Christ. After Jesus' arrest by the Sanhedrin, the religious leaders handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the Roman procurator of Judea. When Pilate was unable to find a reason to condemn Jesus, they accused him of claiming to be King of the Jews.

To appease the crowd, Pilate offered to release either Jesus or Barabbas (a rebel leader), and let them choose. The crowd chose Barabbas, so Pilate sentenced Jesus to be crucified. During the trial, Herod Antipas made a brief appearance, expressing interest in seeing Jesus but ultimately returning him to Pilate (Luke 23:6-12).

In summary, Herod Antipas serves as a key figure in the New Testament, particularly in the stories of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ. His decisions and actions demonstrate the political and religious climate of the time, as well as the tensions between various Jewish factions and the Roman authorities.
