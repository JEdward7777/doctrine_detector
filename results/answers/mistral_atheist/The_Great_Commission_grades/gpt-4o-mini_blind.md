## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The event you're referring to is the Ascension of Jesus, which is described in the New Testament (Acts 1:6-11). According to this account, after Jesus' resurrection, He appeared to His disciples and gave them a set of instructions. However, the specific command you mentioned isn't explicitly stated in the text as the final command before His ascension. Instead, Jesus told them to wait for the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:4-5) and commissioned them to go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20). As an atheistic scholar, I would approach this narrative from a historical and cultural perspective, acknowledging its significance in shaping Western religions while also questioning the historicity of the event itself.

## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
60.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: The response accurately acknowledges the events surrounding Jesus' Ascension and highlights the instructions given to His disciples. However, the perspective provided by an atheistic scholar detracts from the grading as it does not align with a Christian worldview. Additionally, the focus on questioning the historicity of the event could be seen as undermining the foundational beliefs of Christianity.
