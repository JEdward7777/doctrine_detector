  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the relevant biblical passages and the historical context of Jesus' ascension. They accurately identified the events leading up to the ascension and correctly referenced the Great Commission. Additionally, their inclusion of an skeptical perspective as an atheist scholar adds nuance to their analysis. However, the lack of specific mention of the command to make disciples in the text could be seen as a weakness in their argument."
