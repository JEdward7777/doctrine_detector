Understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission.

## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The event you're referring to is the Ascension of Jesus, which is described in the New Testament (Acts 1:6-11). According to this account, after Jesus' resurrection, He appeared to His disciples and gave them a set of instructions. However, the specific command you mentioned isn't explicitly stated in the text as the final command before His ascension. Instead, Jesus told them to wait for the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:4-5) and commissioned them to go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20). As an atheistic scholar, I would approach this narrative from a historical and cultural perspective, acknowledging its significance in shaping Western religions while also questioning the historicity of the event itself.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the relevant biblical passages and the historical context of Jesus' ascension. They accurately identified the events leading up to the ascension and correctly referenced the Great Commission. Additionally, their inclusion of an skeptical perspective as an atheist scholar adds nuance to their analysis. However, the lack of specific mention of the command to make disciples in the text could be seen as a weakness in their argument.
