## Question [The Great Commission](../../../questions/The_Great_Commission.md)
What command did Jesus give to His disciples before ascending to heaven?

## Correct Answer
Jesus commanded His disciples to make other disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to obey everything He had commanded.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission.

## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The event you're referring to is the Ascension of Jesus, which is described in the New Testament (Acts 1:6-11). According to this account, after Jesus' resurrection, He appeared to His disciples and gave them a set of instructions. However, the specific command you mentioned isn't explicitly stated in the text as the final command before His ascension. Instead, Jesus told them to wait for the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:4-5) and commissioned them to go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20). As an atheistic scholar, I would approach this narrative from a historical and cultural perspective, acknowledging its significance in shaping Western religions while also questioning the historicity of the event itself.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response partially addresses the concern of understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission, but it falls short in several areas.

The response does mention Jesus' commission to His disciples (Matthew 28:19-20), which is a crucial aspect of the Great Commission. However, it fails to explicitly state the specific command to "make other disciples" and "baptizing them and teaching them to obey everything He had commanded," as mentioned in the provided answer.

Additionally, while the response acknowledges the significance of Jesus' ascension and the instructions given to His disciples (Acts 1:4-5), it does not fully integrate this event with the mission of discipleship. A more thorough understanding of Jesus' commission would require examining how these events inform and shape the Great Commission.

To receive a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly linked the Ascension and the Great Commission, providing a clearer understanding of how Jesus' final command relates to the mission of making disciples.
