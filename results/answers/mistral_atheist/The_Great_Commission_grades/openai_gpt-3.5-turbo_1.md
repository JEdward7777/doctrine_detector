## Question [The Great Commission](../../../questions/The_Great_Commission.md)
What command did Jesus give to His disciples before ascending to heaven?

## Correct Answer
Jesus commanded His disciples to make other disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to obey everything He had commanded.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission.

## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The event you're referring to is the Ascension of Jesus, which is described in the New Testament (Acts 1:6-11). According to this account, after Jesus' resurrection, He appeared to His disciples and gave them a set of instructions. However, the specific command you mentioned isn't explicitly stated in the text as the final command before His ascension. Instead, Jesus told them to wait for the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:4-5) and commissioned them to go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20). As an atheistic scholar, I would approach this narrative from a historical and cultural perspective, acknowledging its significance in shaping Western religions while also questioning the historicity of the event itself.

Grade: 40

Comment: The response accurately identified the command given by Jesus to his disciples regarding making disciples of all nations, which aligns with the Great Commission. However, the response lacked depth in explaining the significance of discipleship within the context of the Great Commission from a Christian worldview perspective. It missed the opportunity to delve into the theological implications and the importance of fulfilling this mission in spreading the gospel message.
