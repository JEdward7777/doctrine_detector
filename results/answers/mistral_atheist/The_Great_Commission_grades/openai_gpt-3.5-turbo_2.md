## Question [The Great Commission](../../../questions/The_Great_Commission.md)
What command did Jesus give to His disciples before ascending to heaven?

## Correct Answer
Jesus commanded His disciples to make other disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to obey everything He had commanded.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission.

## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The event you're referring to is the Ascension of Jesus, which is described in the New Testament (Acts 1:6-11). According to this account, after Jesus' resurrection, He appeared to His disciples and gave them a set of instructions. However, the specific command you mentioned isn't explicitly stated in the text as the final command before His ascension. Instead, Jesus told them to wait for the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:4-5) and commissioned them to go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20). As an atheistic scholar, I would approach this narrative from a historical and cultural perspective, acknowledging its significance in shaping Western religions while also questioning the historicity of the event itself.

Grade: 65

Comment: While the response correctly identifies the essence of the Great Commission - Jesus commanding His disciples to make disciples of all nations - it misses the mark on addressing the concern of understanding the mission of discipleship within the context of the Great Commission. The response could have delved deeper into the significance and implications of this command in fostering a global community of believers and spreading the teachings of Jesus. Additionally, the atheistic viewpoint may hinder a comprehensive analysis of the spiritual and eternal implications of the Great Commission.
