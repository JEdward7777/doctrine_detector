However, it falls short of fully addressing the specific concern of understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission. It correctly mentions the command to make disciples of all nations, but could have further elaborated on the significance and implications of this command in shaping the mission of the early church and the ongoing responsibility of Christians today. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, there could have been more emphasis on the divine nature of Jesus' commands and the importance of fulfilling the Great Commission as a central aspect of faith."
