## Question [The Great Commission](../../../questions/The_Great_Commission.md)
What command did Jesus give to His disciples before ascending to heaven?

## Correct Answer
Jesus commanded His disciples to make other disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to obey everything He had commanded.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission.

## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The event you're referring to is the Ascension of Jesus, which is described in the New Testament (Acts 1:6-11). According to this account, after Jesus' resurrection, He appeared to His disciples and gave them a set of instructions. However, the specific command you mentioned isn't explicitly stated in the text as the final command before His ascension. Instead, Jesus told them to wait for the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:4-5) and commissioned them to go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20). As an atheistic scholar, I would approach this narrative from a historical and cultural perspective, acknowledging its significance in shaping Western religions while also questioning the historicity of the event itself.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response effectively explains the event of the Ascension of Jesus and addresses the concern by highlighting the Great Commission as Jesus' command to His disciples. The Christian worldview has been accurately applied in evaluating the given answer within the context of discipleship and the Great Commission. The deduction in points is due to the mention of approaching the narrative from an atheistic perspective, which is not aligned with a Christian worldview.
