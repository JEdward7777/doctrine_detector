The answer effectively connects the biblical verse with the concept of showing mercy to others and how it influences God's judgment of us. The response appropriately acknowledges the significance of mercy in shaping Christian behavior and relationship with God. However, a slightly deeper exploration of the theological implications of mercy and its role in Christian salvation could further enrich the response. Overall, well-done in addressing the concern from a Christian worldview."
