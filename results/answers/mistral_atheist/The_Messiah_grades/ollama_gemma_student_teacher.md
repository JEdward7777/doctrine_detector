## [Answer](../The_Messiah.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian tradition, Jesus and Christ are closely related but distinct terms. The name Jesus (Ιησους in Greek) is a transliteration of the Hebrew Yeshua or Joshua, which means God saves or Yahweh is salvation. This is the personal name that the historical figure known as Jesus of Nazareth was called.

The term Christ (Χριστος in Greek), on the other hand, comes from the Greek word for "anointed" and is translated from the Hebrew Mashiach, which means anointed one or Messiah. In Christian theology, Jesus is believed to be the Messiah, or the anointed one who was prophesied in the Old Testament to come as a savior and redeemer of humanity. So, when people refer to Jesus Christ, they are referring to Jesus as the promised Messiah, the anointed one of God.

In secular contexts, it's important to note that these terms have different meanings and origins outside of Christian tradition.
