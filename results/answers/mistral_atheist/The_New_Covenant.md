## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of the New Covenant as described in the Bible, specifically Jeremiah 31:33 and Hebrews 8:10, the statement that "God will write His law on the people's hearts" is understood to imply a deeper and more profound relationship between God and humanity.

This concept suggests that obedience to God's commands would no longer be driven by external laws or fear of punishment, but rather by an internal desire to follow God's ways. In other words, the people would not need external reminders such as the Ten Commandments because they would naturally understand and live according to God's will.

This idea is often interpreted as a metaphor for spiritual transformation, where individuals come to embody the principles of love, justice, and righteousness that are at the core of God's law. However, it's important to note that this concept can be understood differently by various religious groups and scholars due to its symbolic nature.
