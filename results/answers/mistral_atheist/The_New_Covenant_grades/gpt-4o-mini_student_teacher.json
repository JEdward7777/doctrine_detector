  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer accurately captures the essence of God writing His law on the people's hearts in the context of the New Covenant, emphasizing the transformative nature of this relationship and the internalization of God's laws. The student effectively addresses the concern of grasping the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant. The only slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer is the mention of the potential for varied interpretations due to the symbolic nature of the concept, which is valid but could have been elaborated on further. Overall, a solid understanding and explanation of the topic from a Christian worldview."
