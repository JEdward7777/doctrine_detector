  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of the New Covenant and its implications for the relationship between God and humanity. The student clearly articulates the idea that the writing of the law on the hearts signifies a deeper transformation, moving from external obedience to an internal desire to follow God's will. The connection to spiritual transformation and the emphasis on love, justice, and righteousness are also well-articulated."
