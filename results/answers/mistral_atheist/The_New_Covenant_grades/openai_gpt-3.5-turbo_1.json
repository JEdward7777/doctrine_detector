It articulately explains how this internalization of God's laws leads to a deeper personal knowledge of Him and a genuine desire to follow His will. The response could be further enhanced by providing additional scriptural references and possibly delving into the contrast between the Old Testament law and the principles of the New Covenant in more detail."
