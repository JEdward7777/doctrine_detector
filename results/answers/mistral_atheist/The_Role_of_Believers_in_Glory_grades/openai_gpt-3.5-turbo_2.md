## [Answer](../The_Role_of_Believers_in_Glory.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian theology, as presented in the New Testament, the concept of being "glorified with Christ" refers to a state of spiritual perfection and union with God that believers can achieve through faith in Jesus Christ. This idea is rooted in the Gospel accounts, particularly John 17:5 where Jesus prays to His Father for the apostles and all believers that they may be "one as we are one."

Being glorified with Christ implies a transformation of the believer's character and destiny. Through faith in Christ, believers are said to become "new creations" (2 Corinthians 5:17), freed from the power of sin, and united with Christ in His resurrection. This union with Christ is considered a form of glorification, as believers share in Christ's divine nature (2 Peter 1:4).

In the future, at the Second Coming of Christ or at death for those who have died in faith, believers are expected to experience a full and complete glorification when they receive their resurrected bodies. This glorified state is often described as being like the glorified body of Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 15:49).

In this sense, being glorified with Christ is not just a one-time event but an ongoing process for believers, as they strive to live in accordance with the teachings and example of Christ. It represents the ultimate destiny and reward for those who put their faith in Him, embodying the themes of salvation, sanctification, and eternal life in Christian theology.
