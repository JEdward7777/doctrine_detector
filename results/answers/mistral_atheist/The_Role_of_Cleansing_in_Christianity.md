## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Old Testament, the concept of 'cleansing' often refers to ritual purification, particularly in the context of laws surrounding bodily impurities, unclean food, and the sanctity of the Temple. These practices were intended to separate the Israelites from their pagan neighbors, mark them as God's chosen people, and maintain a sense of holiness and order within the community.

However, it's important to note that these rituals were never meant to atone for sin itself, but rather to symbolize repentance and the desire for spiritual cleansing. The Old Testament makes clear that only God can forgive sin (e.g., Leviticus 4:20, Isaiah 1:18).

In the New Testament, the concept of 'cleansing' takes on a profoundly different meaning. Jesus often spoke about spiritual purity and forgiveness, emphasizing the importance of inner transformation rather than outward rituals (Matthew 23:25-26). The New Testament introduces the idea of redemption through faith in Christ, who is portrayed as the ultimate sacrifice for sin (John 3:16, Romans 3:24-25).

In this context, the metaphorical 'cleansing' from sin is achieved not through ritualistic actions but through accepting Jesus' sacrifice and striving to live according to his teachings. This understanding of redemption is central to Christian theology and remains a crucial aspect of Christian spirituality today.
