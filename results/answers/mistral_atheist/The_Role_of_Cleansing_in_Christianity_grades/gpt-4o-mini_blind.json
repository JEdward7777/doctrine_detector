The explanation of how cleansing relates to sin and redemption is well-supported with relevant biblical references. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of Jesus' sacrifice and the role of faith in redemption, as well as the link between cleansing and the work of the Holy Spirit in transforming believers."
