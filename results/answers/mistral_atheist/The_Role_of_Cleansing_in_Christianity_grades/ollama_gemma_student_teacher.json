  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that clearly demonstrates an understanding of the relationship between the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible and New Testament teachings about sin and redemption from a Christian perspective. The student effectively explains the difference between Old Testament ritual cleansing and the New Testament emphasis on spiritual purity through faith in Christ."
