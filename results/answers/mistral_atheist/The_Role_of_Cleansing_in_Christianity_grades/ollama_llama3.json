  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of \"cleansing\" in both the Old Testament and New Testament, and how it relates to sin and redemption. The author provides specific biblical references to support their claims, which is commendable.\n\nThe response also shows an awareness of the concern you raised, highlighting the importance of understanding the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings in order to appreciate the significance of Christ's redemptive work.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response does not explicitly address how the concept of \"cleansing\" changes from the Old Testament to the New Testament. While it is implied that Jesus' sacrifice provides a new way of achieving cleansing, this could be more explicitly stated.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical concept of \"cleansing,\" but could benefit from further development and explicit connections between the Old and New Testaments."
