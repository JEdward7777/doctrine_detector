The response mentions various interpretations and cultural contexts, but it lacks depth in explaining the theological significance of God's choice. Additionally, the inclusion of an atheistic perspective could be perceived as downplaying the doctrinal importance of divine selection in the Christian worldview. To improve, the student should delve more into how God's selection of Moses and King David reflects His sovereignty, purposes, and faithfulness to His covenant people."
