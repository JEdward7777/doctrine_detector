  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of chosenness in Abrahamic religions. The student provides clear examples of Moses and King David and discusses the cultural, societal, and divine factors that contribute to the concept of selection. The inclusion of an atheistic perspective adds nuance to the discussion. Overall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern about recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders."
