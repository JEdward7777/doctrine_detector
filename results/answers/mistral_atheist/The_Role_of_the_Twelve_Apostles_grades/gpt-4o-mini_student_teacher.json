  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-informed explanation of the significance of the Twelve Apostles in Christianity, considering their role as eyewitnesses, disseminators of Jesus' teachings, and early Christian leaders. However, the student fell short of directly addressing the importance of the apostles being chosen by Jesus as His closest followers and continuing His teachings after His ascension, which is a crucial aspect from a Christian worldview. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but could have been more explicitly aligned with the specific concern provided."
