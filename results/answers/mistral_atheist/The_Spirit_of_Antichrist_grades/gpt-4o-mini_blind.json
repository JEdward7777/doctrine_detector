The explanation of how the term \"antichrist\" is used to describe a spirit or attitude that opposes Jesus Christ is accurate. However, the inclusion of the perspective of an atheistic scholar detracts from the overall theological focus of the response. It would have been better to provide a more nuanced exploration within a Christian worldview without diluting it with a conflicting worldview."
