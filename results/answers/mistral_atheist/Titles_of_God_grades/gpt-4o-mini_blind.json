  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response effectively lists verses where God is referred to as \"Almighty\" and provides a good selection from both the Old and New Testaments. The student acknowledges that the term may not directly translate as \"Almighty\" in the original languages, which shows a level of understanding regarding translational nuances. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the significance and implications of God being referred to as \"Almighty\" in the context of Christian theology. This additional depth would enhance the theological insight provided in the answer."
