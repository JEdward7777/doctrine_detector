  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough response with relevant Bible verses that refer to God as \"Almighty.\" The examples given showcase a good understanding of the concept of God's omnipotence. However, the student missed mentioning some of the specific titles like \"Almighty God\", \"Lord Almighty\", and \"Lord God Almighty\" that are commonly used in the Bible. Improving on the comprehensiveness of the answer by including these specific titles would have made the response more complete."
