However, the initial statement about the meaning of these titles is not entirely accurate, as it does not take into account the nuances of the original languages and the cultural context in which they were written. Nonetheless, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding God's character and His attributes, particularly His power and authority.\n\nTo improve this response further, one could delve deeper into the cultural significance of these titles, explore their implications for our understanding of God's sovereignty, and consider how recognizing these titles can inform our prayer life, worship, and daily lives as Christians."
