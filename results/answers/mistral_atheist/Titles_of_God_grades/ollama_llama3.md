## [Answer](../Titles_of_God.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, there are several titles or attributes of God that connote His omnipotence, one of which is "Almighty" or "God Almighty." Here are a few examples from both the Old and New Testaments where God is referred to as such:

1. Exodus 6:3 - "I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name Yahweh I did not make myself known to them." (NRSV)
2. Genesis 17:1 - "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, 'I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless.'" (NRSV)
3. Psalm 57:2 - "I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me." (NRSV)
4. Deuteronomy 10:17 - "For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe." (NRSV)
5. Revelation 16:7 - "And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God: 'Throw your bowls on the earth.' So they threw them, and flames came out from the altar devouring them; and thunder sounded, and lightning flashed, and the earth was lightened by the lightning." (NRSV)

These verses highlight the power and authority of God throughout the Bible. It is important to note that these titles do not necessarily translate literally as "Almighty" in the original languages but convey similar ideas of God's omnipotence.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a good overview of biblical passages that refer to God as "Almighty" or similar titles, which helps to highlight God's omnipotence. However, the initial statement about the meaning of these titles is not entirely accurate, as it does not take into account the nuances of the original languages and the cultural context in which they were written. Nonetheless, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding God's character and His attributes, particularly His power and authority.

To improve this response further, one could delve deeper into the cultural significance of these titles, explore their implications for our understanding of God's sovereignty, and consider how recognizing these titles can inform our prayer life, worship, and daily lives as Christians.
