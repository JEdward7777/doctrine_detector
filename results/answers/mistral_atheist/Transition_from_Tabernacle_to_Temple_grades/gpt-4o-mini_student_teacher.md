## [Answer](../Transition_from_Tabernacle_to_Temple.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The cessation of the use of the Tabernacle by the Israelites can be traced back to two significant events as recorded in the Old Testament.

First, after the Exodus from Egypt and the wandering in the wilderness, the Israelites arrived at the territory promised to them. Here, they built a permanent temple in Jerusalem under King Solomon (1 Kings 6:1), which replaced the mobile Tabernacle. This shift occurred around 950 BCE.

Second, during the Babylonian captivity (586 BCE), the First Temple was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II. After the Jews returned from exile under Cyrus the Great in 538 BCE, they rebuilt the Second Temple but did not restore the Tabernacle as it was a portable structure designed for their nomadic existence in the wilderness.

So, in essence, the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle due to settlement and the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem, followed by its destruction and subsequent rebuilding as a permanent structure. This transition reflects important shifts in the religious practices and social organization of the ancient Israelites over time.

Comment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple, incorporating key events from the Old Testament. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and directly focused on the specific reason for the Israelites' cessation of using the tabernacle, as outlined in the reference answer.
