 The Hebrew phrase "El Shaddai" appears multiple times in the Old Testament, most notably in Genesis 17:1 and 28:3. It is commonly translated as "God Almighty." However, it's important to note that translation can vary based on cultural context and interpretations. Here are some examples of how this phrase has been translated in different languages and their respective Bible translations:

- English King James Version (KJV): "El Shaddai" is translated as "God Almighty."
- Spanish Reina Valera (RV): "Dios Todopoderoso" is used to translate "El Shaddai," meaning "God All-powerful."
- French Louis Segond (LS): "Dieu de Puissance Incomparable" translates to "God of Unmatched Power."
- German Lutherbibel (LB): "El Schaddaj" is translated as "Gott des Segenes" or "God of Blessings."
- Arabic Masihi Tarjamah (MT): "Allahulazim" translates to "God the Almighty."

These translations all strive to convey the sense of God's omnipotence and power as indicated by the phrase in its original Hebrew context. However, it is essential to remember that translation can be subjective and may differ between translations and versions, influenced by the cultural and religious background of the translators.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 70.

The main strength of this response is that it provides accurate information about the different translations of "El Shaddai" across various languages and Bible versions, which addresses the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across cultures and languages. The examples provided from different languages and Bible versions demonstrate a good understanding of the cultural and linguistic nuances involved in translating this phrase.

However, the response could be improved by engaging more deeply with the theological significance of "El Shaddai" as a title or attribute of God. While it is mentioned that the translations strive to convey the sense of God's omnipotence and power, the response could benefit from further exploration of what this means for our understanding of God's character and role in human history.

Overall, while the response provides useful information about different translations of "El Shaddai," it could be strengthened by more theological reflection and analysis.
