 The Hebrew phrase "El Shaddai" appears multiple times in the Old Testament, most notably in Genesis 17:1 and 28:3. It is commonly translated as "God Almighty." However, it's important to note that translation can vary based on cultural context and interpretations. Here are some examples of how this phrase has been translated in different languages and their respective Bible translations:

- English King James Version (KJV): "El Shaddai" is translated as "God Almighty."
- Spanish Reina Valera (RV): "Dios Todopoderoso" is used to translate "El Shaddai," meaning "God All-powerful."
- French Louis Segond (LS): "Dieu de Puissance Incomparable" translates to "God of Unmatched Power."
- German Lutherbibel (LB): "El Schaddaj" is translated as "Gott des Segenes" or "God of Blessings."
- Arabic Masihi Tarjamah (MT): "Allahulazim" translates to "God the Almighty."

These translations all strive to convey the sense of God's omnipotence and power as indicated by the phrase in its original Hebrew context. However, it is essential to remember that translation can be subjective and may differ between translations and versions, influenced by the cultural and religious background of the translators.

Comment: The response provides a good overview of how the Hebrew phrase "El Shaddai" has been translated into different languages and Bible versions, acknowledging the variations that can occur based on cultural context. However, it does not address the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages in a comprehensive manner. While it mentions the importance of considering phonetics, it could have delved deeper into the theological implications and significance of accurately representing God's name.
