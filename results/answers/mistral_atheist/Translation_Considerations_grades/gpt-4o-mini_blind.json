They have effectively explained the symbolic meanings of these terms in the Bible and highlighted the importance of preserving them in translations for enhancing readers' understanding. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to emphasize the theological significance of these terms in relation to God's relationship with His people, thereby aligning the response more closely with a Christian-specific worldview."
