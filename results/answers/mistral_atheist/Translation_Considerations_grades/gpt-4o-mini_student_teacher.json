  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of retaining terms like \"Zion\" and \"Daughter\" in translations of Biblical texts. They effectively explain the cultural and historical significance of these terms in their original Hebrew context and how preserving them enhances readers' understanding and appreciation of the text. The student's response aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the rich figurative meanings that contribute to maintaining the connection to Biblical heritage and teachings. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the spiritual significance of these terms, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
