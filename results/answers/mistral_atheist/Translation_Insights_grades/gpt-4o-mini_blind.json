  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: While the answer provides some valuable insights into the translations of \"image of God\" when applied to humans and Jesus, it falls short of a Christian-specific worldview. The student's attempt to approach the question purely from a historical and linguistic perspective neglects the theological significance of these translations within Christianity. A higher grade could be achieved by incorporating more references to Scripture, theological concepts, and the implications of these translations for Christian faith and practice."
