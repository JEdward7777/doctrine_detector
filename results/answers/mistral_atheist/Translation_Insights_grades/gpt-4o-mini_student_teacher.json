  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and well-reasoned answer from a historical and linguistic perspective, offering nuanced translations for the phrases 'image of God' as applied to humans and Jesus. However, the answer lacks depth in exploring the theological and Christian-specific implications of these translations. The student could have delved deeper into how these translations impact our understanding of biblical teachings and the significance of human and Jesus' relation to God. In a Christian-specific worldview, it is essential to consider the theological implications of these translations, which were not fully addressed in the response."
