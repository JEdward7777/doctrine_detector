It addresses the concern by discussing the importance of clarity in translation and maintaining reverence for God's name within the cultural and historical context. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly mention the fear of mispronouncing 'Yahweh' as a reason for using 'LORD', as stated in the initial answer."
