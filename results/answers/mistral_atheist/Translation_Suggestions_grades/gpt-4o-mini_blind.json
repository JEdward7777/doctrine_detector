  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 95. The student provides a thorough and well-articulated list of alternative translations for the phrase 'to be zealous' that reflect its biblical meaning. Each alternative captures different aspects of zealotry as presented in the Bible, and the language used is precise and fitting for the context. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the depth and nuances of biblical zeal and effectively conveys this understanding through the translations provided. Great job!"
