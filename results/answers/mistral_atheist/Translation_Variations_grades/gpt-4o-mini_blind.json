  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 75.\n\nComment: The student provided alternative translations for 'covenant faithfulness' that demonstrate a good understanding of the concept and its implications. The translations provided offer insightful interpretations, although some could be further strengthened by emphasizing the divine or spiritual aspect inherent in the original term. Additionally, tying the translations more explicitly to the Biblical context would enhance the overall clarity and relevance of the response for a Christian worldview."
