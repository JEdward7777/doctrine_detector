  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful alternative translations that explore different interpretations of the term 'covenant faithfulness.' The translations they offered, such as \"Divine Loyalty,\" \"Sacred Trust,\" \"Promised Integrity,\" \"Faithful Agreement,\" and \"Ethical Fidelity,\" do expand the understanding of the concept in various contexts. However, their translations do not directly align with the Christian-specific worldview as closely as the reference answer provided by the teacher. Encouraging the student to further connect their interpretations with Christian theology would enhance their response."
