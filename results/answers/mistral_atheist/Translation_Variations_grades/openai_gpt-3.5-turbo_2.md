3. Promised Integrity: This translation emphasizes the importance of upholding promises, even in the face of adversity or challenging circumstances. It can be used in a secular sense to describe personal conduct or societal expectations.

4. Faithful Agreement: In this context, 'faithful' implies steadfastness and reliability, while 'agreement' refers to a mutual understanding or contract. This term could be employed in discussions about moral codes, treaties, or any binding arrangement among individuals or groups.

5. Ethical Fidelity: By focusing on the ethical aspects of keeping promises or adhering to agreements, this translation suggests an unwavering commitment to moral principles and personal integrity. This term is particularly useful in discussions about ethics, morality, and social norms.
