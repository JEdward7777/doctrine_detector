  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides alternative translations of the term 'faithful love' from a secular perspective, which can be helpful in understanding the concept from different angles. However, the responses do not directly address biblical terms or concepts, which is the primary concern given. To improve the grade, the translations could have been explicitly related to biblical themes or teachings to deepen understanding in the Christian context."
