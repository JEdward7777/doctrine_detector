1. Divine Loyalty: This term emphasizes the unwavering commitment of a deity to its followers or promises, as understood within religious contexts. However, in an atheistic perspective, it could be seen as a metaphorical or symbolic representation of unchanging principles or agreements among people.

2. Sacred Trust: This term highlights the idea that certain commitments or agreements hold a special significance and are treated with great importance and respect. In an atheistic context, it might refer to social contracts or ethical guidelines.

3. Promised Integrity: This translation emphasizes the importance of upholding promises, even in the face of adversity or challenging circumstances. It can be used in a secular sense to describe personal conduct or societal expectations.

4. Faithful Agreement: In this context, 'faithful' implies steadfastness and reliability, while 'agreement' refers to a mutual understanding or contract. This term could be employed in discussions about moral codes, treaties, or any binding arrangement among individuals or groups.

5. Ethical Fidelity: By focusing on the ethical aspects of keeping promises or adhering to agreements, this translation suggests an unwavering commitment to moral principles and personal integrity. This term is particularly useful in discussions about ethics, morality, and social norms.
