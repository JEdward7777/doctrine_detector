The answer provides a sound explanation of how context determines the meaning of the term 'Lord' in various situations. However, the answer could have been strengthened by including specific examples from Christian scriptures to illustrate the significance of 'Lord' when referring to God. Additionally, a more explicit connection to Christian theology and teachings could have deepened the analysis within a Christian specific worldview."
