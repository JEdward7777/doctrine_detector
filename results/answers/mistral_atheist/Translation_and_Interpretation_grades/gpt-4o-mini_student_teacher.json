  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of how the term 'Lord' can have different meanings based on context. The student correctly highlights the importance of context in determining the specific meaning of the term. However, the student could have further emphasized the significance of capitalization in distinguishing when 'Lord' refers to God versus ordinary people, as indicated in the reference answer. Additionally, integrating more direct references to biblical examples or principles could have strengthened the student's response in relation to the concern about proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impacting the understanding of scripture and the nature of God."
