## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the original Greek texts of the New Testament, the word translated as "truly" or "verily" is "amen." It was not just a mere affirmative particle but carried more weight, often signifying confirmation, assurance, certainty, or solemnity. However, cultural context plays a significant role in interpretation. In ancient Jewish usage, "amen" served as both an affirmation and a blessing.

As such, when Jesus used the phrase "amen, amen," it might be more accurately rendered as "verily, verily," "truly, truly," or even "I assure you" depending on the intended emphasis and audience understanding. The King James Version's translation of "verily, verily" emphasizes Jesus' solemnity and gravity in making these statements. Other translations might use simpler phrases like "I tell you the truth," which convey certainty and reliability but may lose some of the original cultural nuances.

In summary, potential translations could include:
- Verily, verily (KJV)
- Truly, truly
- I assure you
- I tell you the truth
- Indeed, indeed
Each of these renditions reflects a slightly different emphasis and tone from the original Greek text, with variations in cultural context and interpretation.
