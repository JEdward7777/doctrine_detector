  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 90.\n\nThe answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the original Greek word \"amen\" and its implications when used by Jesus in phrases like \"truly I tell you.\" The student effectively discusses the significance of \"amen\" in both affirmation and blessing within the Jewish cultural context. They also provide a variety of accurate potential translations, explaining the nuances and implications of each option based on the intended emphasis and audience understanding. \n\nThe only potential improvement could be a deeper exploration of how these translations impact the doctrinal significance and teachings of Jesus, linking it back to a Christian worldview. Including this aspect would provide a more comprehensive analysis.\n\nOverall, a well-reasoned and informed response."
