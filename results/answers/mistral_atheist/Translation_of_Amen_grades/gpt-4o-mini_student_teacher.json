  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of the word \"amen\" in the original Greek texts and how it is translated as \"truly\" or \"verily\". They discuss the nuances and cultural context involved in interpreting Jesus' use of the phrase. Additionally, they provide a variety of potential translations based on different emphases and tones, showing a comprehensive understanding of the complexity of biblical translation. \n\nHowever, the student's answer did not directly align with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasized translations like \"yes, I tell you sincerely\" or \"what I am telling you is true\". While the student's answer was thorough and well-reasoned, a closer alignment with the reference answer might have been beneficial for a more precise interpretation based on a Christian-specific worldview."
