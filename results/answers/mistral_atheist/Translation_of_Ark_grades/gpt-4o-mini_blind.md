## [Answer](../Translation_of_Ark.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The term "ark" (Hebrew: תְּיָרַת, Teivah) in the Hebrew Bible primarily refers to the vessel used by Noah during the Great Flood. It is described as a large, waterproof structure that housed Noah, his family, and a collection of animals for survival. The ark was cuboidal in shape (Genesis 6:15), with three decks (Genesis 6:16).

In the New Testament of the Christian Bible, the term "ark" is used metaphorically to represent salvation or safety. For example, 1 Peter 3:20 states, "who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the ark (Greek: κυβερνήτηρ, kubernetēr) during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water."

In the Quran, there is no direct equivalent to the Noah's Ark story as it appears in the Hebrew Bible. Instead, the Quran describes Prophet Nuh (Noah) as constructing a large ship, which he and his followers boarded to escape the flood (Quran 11:37-48). In this context, the word used for the vessel is 'safina' (Arabic: سفينة), which translates more broadly as "ship."

In all three religious texts, the ark represents safety, survival, and the preservation of life in the face of catastrophe. However, it is important to note that each tradition has its unique interpretations and understandings of the ark's specific features, role, and symbolism.
