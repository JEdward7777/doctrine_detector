  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"ark\" as used in different religious texts, connecting the literal and metaphorical meanings. The explanation is clear and well-supported with references to specific verses. The response accurately discusses the term's contextual meanings within the different religious traditions. However, it lacks a direct engagement with the concern provided, which is focused on accurate translation and contextual understanding of terms. While the response does mention the importance of unique interpretations, a more explicit link to accurate translation and contextual meaning would have further enhanced the response."
