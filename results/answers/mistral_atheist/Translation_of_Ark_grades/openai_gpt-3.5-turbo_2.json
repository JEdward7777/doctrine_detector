The response accurately relates how the term is used in metaphorical sense and the textual differences. However, the response could have further addressed the concern by emphasizing the importance of accurate translation and understanding the contextual meaning of the term \"ark\" in each religious text. It covered a wide range of information but could have delved deeper into the specific concern provided."
