  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"ark\" in the context of Noah's Ark, and accurately distinguishes its representation in different religious texts. It also acknowledges the broader usage of the term in biblical narratives such as the Ark of the Covenant and Moses' basket. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of accurate translation and contextual understanding when interpreting scripture. However, in terms of a Christian worldview, a more direct connection to the theological significance of the ark in representing salvation and safety could enhance the response further."
