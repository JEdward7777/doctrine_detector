It effectively clarifies the spiritual implications of being 'begotten' for believers, emphasizing the concept of spiritual regeneration and renewal. However, from a Christian-specific worldview, it could have further emphasized the unique significance of Jesus Christ as the begotten Son of God in relation to believers' spiritual rebirth."
