  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a variety of suggested translations for the term 'church' that reflect different aspects of its meaning effectively. Some of the translations provided may not be as commonly used or may have specific connotations tied to certain religions, which could be further clarified. Additionally, from a Christian perspective, terms like \"House of God\" and \"Temple\" would typically be understood in a narrower sense referring to specific religious contexts. Overall, a good effort in presenting diverse translations with room for some refinement in alignment with a Christian worldview."
