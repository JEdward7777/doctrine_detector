  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of suggested translations for the term 'church,' but the concern of accurately representing the church's inclusive nature in translations was not fully addressed. While some terms like \"congregation\" and \"assembly\" touch on the idea of all believers coming together, many of the other translations do not explicitly convey the inclusive nature of the church. The student could have improved their answer by focusing more on terms that emphasize the unity and gathering of all believers, as per the reference answer provided by the teacher."
