The student correctly identifies terms that emphasize the gathering nature of the church, its social aspects, and its spiritual significance. The answer also acknowledges the broader application of some terms across different religions. While the reference answer suggests more generic terms like \"gathering together\" or \"assembly,\" the student's response offers more nuanced and faith-specific translations that align with the Christian worldview."
