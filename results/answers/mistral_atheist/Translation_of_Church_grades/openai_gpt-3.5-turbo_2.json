However, some terms like \"House of God\" and \"House of Worship\" may not fully capture the inclusivity aspect as they can imply a specific deity or faith tradition. Additionally, while the response includes diverse terms, it could have further emphasized the importance of inclusivity in translating these terms within a Christian context."
