  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response with various translations for \"Lord Yahweh\" in different languages. They showed an understanding of the importance of preserving the cultural and religious context while ensuring clarity in translation. However, the reference answer from the teacher emphasized considering grammatical structure in the target language, which the student did not address explicitly in their response. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong grasp of the topic but could have further emphasized the importance of grammatical considerations in translation."
