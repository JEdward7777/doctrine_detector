  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach to translating the terms 'Hades' and 'Sheol.' They have offered additional translation options that respect the biblical meanings of these terms while considering their cultural nuances. The student appropriately acknowledges the varying interpretations of these terms based on cultural context and individual beliefs. However, from a Christian specific worldview, it would have been beneficial for the student to emphasize the specific biblical connotations and theological implications of 'Hades' and 'Sheol' within the context of the Bible, aligning the translations more closely with the doctrinal understanding of these terms. Overall, a solid response with room for further theological depth."
