  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer at 80.\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a good attempt at providing culturally sensitive translations for the terms 'Hades' and 'Sheol'. They offer thoughtful alternative translations that attempt to capture the nuanced meanings of these terms in both Greek and Hebrew contexts. However, the student's answer could be improved by being more focused on maintaining accurate biblical representation, as per the specified concern. The reference answer from the teacher provides more straightforward and concise translations that align closely with biblical meanings.\n\nOverall, the student has shown a commendable effort in considering different cultural perspectives, but they could enhance their response by prioritizing accuracy in biblical representation."
