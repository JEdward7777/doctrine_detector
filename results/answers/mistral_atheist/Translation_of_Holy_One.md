## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 Translating religious terms like 'Holy One' can be challenging due to their cultural, historical, and philosophical contexts. However, I will attempt to provide some general guidelines for translation in various languages. Please note that these are not definitive translations but rather suggestions based on common usage in each language:

1. English: "Holy One" could be translated as "The Holy One" (with a capital 'H' and 'O' to indicate its religious connotation). In biblical Hebrew, the term is "Qodesh," which often refers to something set apart for God's use or dedicated to Him.

2. Spanish: "El Santo Único" – This translates directly from English but emphasizes the uniqueness of the Holy One.

3. German: "Der Heilige Eine" – In German, "Eine" (One) is used to convey the idea of a unique and singular entity, as in God being the one true deity.

4. French: "L'unique Saint" or "Le Saint unique" – The word "Saint" translates to "Holy" in English, and the use of "unique" emphasizes the singular nature of God.

5. Hebrew: "HaKodesh HaEl" – In biblical Hebrew, "HaKodesh" (The Holy) is often used to describe God, while "HaEl" translates to "God."

6. Arabic: "Al-Muqaddas Al-Ahad" or "Allah Al-Qudus" – The first translation emphasizes the uniqueness of God, while the second uses the term "Allah," the Islamic name for God, along with "Al-Qudus" (The Holy).

7. Mandarin Chinese: "圣之一" (Shèng zhī yī) – In Chinese, "圣之一" means "The One Holy." It is a more literal translation that emphasizes the uniqueness of God as the one true deity.
