  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful and comprehensive translations for the term 'Holy One' in various languages, taking into account the cultural nuances and religious implications. However, the translations could have been more closely aligned with the teacher's reference answer, which emphasizes retaining the meaning of holiness and the implication of 'God' or 'the Set Apart One.' Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the complexity of translating religious terms while maintaining theological accuracy."
