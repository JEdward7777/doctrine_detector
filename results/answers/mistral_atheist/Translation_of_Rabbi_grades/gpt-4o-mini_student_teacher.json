  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the various considerations that should be made when translating the term \"Rabbi\" into different languages. They have addressed historical context, religious significance, cultural sensitivity, gender equity, linguistic considerations, and regional differences effectively. However, while the response is comprehensive, it lacks direct reference to the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The student could have strengthened their answer by explicitly connecting these considerations to how they relate to portraying Jesus as more than just a schoolteacher within a Christian worldview."
