The attention to historical context, religious reverence, cultural sensitivity, gender equity, linguistic appropriateness, and regional differences demonstrates a thorough understanding of the complexities involved in translation. The only minor critique is that it could have explicitly connected the importance of maintaining Jesus' divine and authoritative role as a teacher with the translation considerations outlined."
