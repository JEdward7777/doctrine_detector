  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful analysis of the factors to consider when translating the term \"Rabbi\" while maintaining historical accuracy, religious reverence, and cultural sensitivity. It addresses the concern of accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith by emphasizing the importance of not reducing Jesus to merely a schoolteacher and considering how teachers are addressed in the target language. The response could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the translation considerations to the Christian worldview and the unique significance of Jesus as the ultimate teacher and spiritual leader in Christianity. Nevertheless, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
