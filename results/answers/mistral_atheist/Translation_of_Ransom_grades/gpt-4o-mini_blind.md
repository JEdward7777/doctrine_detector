Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for the term "ransom" in various languages, which demonstrates good research and attention to detail. The answer also maintains a neutral and culturally respectful tone, which is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, addressing the term "ransom" without any religious connotations misses a crucial opportunity to explain the deep theological significance of ransom in Christianity, particularly in relation to the ransom paid by Jesus Christ for humanity's salvation. Encouraging the student to include a brief note on the Christian understanding of ransom would strengthen the answer from a doctrinal perspective.
