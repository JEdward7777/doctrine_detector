However, the concern specifically emphasized ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic contexts. The translations provided by the student lack the theological depth and emphasis on the action of making a payment for redemption as highlighted in the reference answer. While the translations are culturally sensitive, they do not fully convey the theological significance of the term 'ransom.'"
