Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for the term "ransom" in various languages and maintained a culturally respectful tone. However, the concern specifically emphasized ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic contexts. The translations provided by the student lack the theological depth and emphasis on the action of making a payment for redemption as highlighted in the reference answer. While the translations are culturally sensitive, they do not fully convey the theological significance of the term 'ransom.'
