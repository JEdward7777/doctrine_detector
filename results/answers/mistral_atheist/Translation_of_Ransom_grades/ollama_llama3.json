The inclusion of culturally sensitive expressions and context-specific translations shows that the author is mindful of the potential connotations and implications of using theological terms in different cultures.\n\nHowever, while this response provides a comprehensive list of translations, it does not directly address the concern about ensuring accurate understanding of theological terms across linguistic and cultural contexts. The provided answer does not explicitly connect the concept of \"ransom\" to its biblical context or theological significance, which is the primary concern.\n\nTo improve this response, providing a clear explanation of how the concept of \"ransom\" is understood in different cultures and languages, while also highlighting its theological relevance and implications, would be beneficial. This could involve discussing how the concept of redemption or liberation is perceived differently across cultures, and how biblical concepts like Christ's sacrifice as a ransom for humanity can be shared effectively across linguistic and cultural boundaries.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of linguistic and cultural variations in translating theological terms, but could benefit from more explicit exploration of the theological significance and implications of these translations."
