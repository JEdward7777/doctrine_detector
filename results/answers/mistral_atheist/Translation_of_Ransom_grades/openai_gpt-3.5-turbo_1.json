However, from a Christian perspective, there is a missed opportunity to highlight the theological significance of the term \"ransom\" in relation to Christ's atoning sacrifice. It would have been beneficial to include a brief explanation of the concept of ransom in Christianity to emphasize its spiritual significance in addition to the linguistic translations."
