The translations provided maintain a neutral and culturally sensitive tone, but do not delve into the theological significance of ransom in Christianity, such as the concept of Christ's ransom for humanity. To improve the response from a Christian worldview perspective, it should have included how the concept of ransom is central to Christian theology, explaining the spiritual implications and significance behind the term in light of Christ's sacrificial act."
