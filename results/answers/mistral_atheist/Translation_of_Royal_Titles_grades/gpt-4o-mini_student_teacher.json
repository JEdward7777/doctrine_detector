  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, which demonstrates good research and effort. However, the concern specified the importance of accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings. The reference answer from the teacher suggests translating as 'Your Highness,' 'Your Excellency,' or using a natural way of addressing a ruler in the target language, which aligns more closely with biblical teachings of respect and honor. While the student's answer is informative, it could be improved by emphasizing the importance of respectful and appropriate translation within biblical contexts."
