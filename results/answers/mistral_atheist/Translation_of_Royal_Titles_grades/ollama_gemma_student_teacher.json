  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides a comprehensive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages.\n* Includes examples from diverse cultures, including Arabic and Chinese.\n* Offers additional information about cultural contexts and variations in usage.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Does not address the concern regarding biblical teachings or potential sensitivities.\n* The translation suggestions \"your Highness\" and \"your Excellency\" are more appropriate for addressing royalty in general, not specifically \"Your Majesty.\"\n\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student could elaborate on the significance of respecting titles in different cultures and their importance within biblical contexts.\n* The suggestions could be tailored more specifically to situations where biblical principles are relevant, considering potential sensitivities towards royalty.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept and provides a thorough analysis of various language translations. However, addressing the concern related to biblical teachings and offering more context-sensitive suggestions would further enhance the quality of the response."
