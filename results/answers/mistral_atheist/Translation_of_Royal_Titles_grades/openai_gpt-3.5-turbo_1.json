  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, which demonstrates a strong understanding of language variations. However, the concern for ensuring accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings could have been addressed more explicitly. It would have been beneficial to relate the translations to biblical teachings on respect for authority or rulership. Overall, a well-researched and informative response."
