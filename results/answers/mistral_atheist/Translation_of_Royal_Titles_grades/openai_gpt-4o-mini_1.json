  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, demonstrating a good understanding of the concept. The concern for accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings is addressed by providing translations that uphold respect for authority and reflect proper etiquette when addressing royalty or high-ranking officials. The only room for improvement could be explicitly connecting the importance of respectful language to biblical teachings, but overall, the response is well-researched and appropriate."
