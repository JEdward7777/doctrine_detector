  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, demonstrating a high level of accuracy and respect for different cultural contexts. An additional consideration from a Christian worldview could be to emphasize the importance of showing honor and respect to authority figures, as instructed in biblical teachings (Romans 13:1-7, 1 Peter 2:13-17). Overall, the response is well-researched and conscientious in addressing the concern raised."
