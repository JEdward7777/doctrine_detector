However, from a Christian-specific worldview, it could have emphasized the biblical understanding of saints as believers in Christ rather than individuals recognized for exceptional holiness or virtues. Additionally, mentioning the importance of saints as intercessors in some Christian traditions would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the response. Further elaboration on the biblical basis for saints would have been beneficial."
