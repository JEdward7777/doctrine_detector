  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and informative response regarding the term 'saints' across various cultures and religions. However, the recommended translations provided are slightly broader and do not directly address the concern of using inclusive language specifically for all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. The student could have focused more on providing translations that specifically encompass all believers in Jesus while maintaining cultural sensitivity."
