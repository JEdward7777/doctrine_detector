However, it could have provided more clarity on how to do so within a Christian worldview, particularly by emphasizing the shared identity of believers in Jesus as saints without emphasizing specific denominations or divisions. Additionally, there is room for improvement in linking the concept of saints to holiness and virtues as central aspects within Christianity."
