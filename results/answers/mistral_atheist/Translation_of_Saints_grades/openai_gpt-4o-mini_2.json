It acknowledges the variations in the concept of sainthood across different cultures and religions. The suggested translations align well with the concern of using inclusive language to represent all believers in Jesus without excluding specific Christian groups. A minor improvement could be to emphasize the universal nature of believers in Jesus, transcending specific Christian denominations, even further."
