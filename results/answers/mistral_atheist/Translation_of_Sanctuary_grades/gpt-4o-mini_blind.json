  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85. \n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to translating the term 'sanctuary' in modern texts. They consider historical and cultural context, linguistic nuances, consultation with experts, sensitivity to cultural meanings, and the target audience. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the answer could have emphasized the importance of accurately conveying the religious significance of 'sanctuary' in the context of Christianity. It would have been beneficial to highlight the sacred meaning of sanctuary as a place of worship, refuge, and divine presence in Christianity. Additionally, they could have mentioned the importance of capturing the theological implications of sanctuary in translations to ensure doctrinal correctness. Overall, the response is well-structured and insightful but could have been strengthened by incorporating a Christian-specific perspective on the term."
