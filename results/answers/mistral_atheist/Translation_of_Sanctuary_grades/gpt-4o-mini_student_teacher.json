  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive response that considers various aspects of translating the term 'sanctuary' in modern texts. They appropriately address the historical and cultural context, linguistic nuances, collaboration with experts, sensitivity in translation, and the target audience. However, the student's answer lacks a clear emphasis on ensuring the accurate portrayal of the Biblical definition of 'sanctuary,' which was the specific concern highlighted in the question. While they touch on the importance of cultural sensitivities and historical context, the primary focus should have been on maintaining the original meaning as per the Biblical definition. This comprehensive and well-thought-out response would have significantly benefitted from a more explicit connection to preserving the Biblical significance of the term 'sanctuary.'"
