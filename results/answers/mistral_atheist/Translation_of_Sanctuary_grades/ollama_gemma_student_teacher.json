They provide a well-reasoned and informative explanation of the various factors to consider when translating the term, including historical context, linguistic nuances, and cultural sensitivity. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific challenges of translating 'sanctuary' in modern texts while upholding the biblical definition. Additionally, the student's suggestion of consulting experts in the field of biblical studies would strengthen the overall argument."
