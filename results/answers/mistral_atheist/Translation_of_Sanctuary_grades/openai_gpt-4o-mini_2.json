It emphasizes the importance of accurately reflecting the Biblical definition of 'sanctuary' as a holy and sacred place. The suggestions align well with the concern of ensuring proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms to maintain their original meaning. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly tie back each point to the Biblical context to reinforce the Christian worldview perspective."
