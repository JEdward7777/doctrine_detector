1. Protection: The idea that the Savior rescues us implies that God plays an active protective role in our lives, shielding us from harm and offering safety in times of trouble or danger.
2. Deliverance: By defining the Savior as one who delivers, it suggests that God is not only a protector but also an emancipator. This interpretation emphasizes that God can free us from bondage, suffering, or negative circumstances to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.
