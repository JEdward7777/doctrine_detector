The inclusion of examples from different religious traditions demonstrates a broader understanding of the concept.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the spiritual or existential interpretations of the Savior figure in different Christian traditions. Additionally, addressing the connection between this translation and specific biblical passages or theological concepts would strengthen the overall argument."
