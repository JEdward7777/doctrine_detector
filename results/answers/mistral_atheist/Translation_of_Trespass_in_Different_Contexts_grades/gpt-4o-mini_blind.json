  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful analysis of the implications of translating 'trespass' as 'sin' or 'breaking the rule' within a church context. They have effectively highlighted the cultural, linguistic, and theological considerations involved in such translations. The answer shows a good understanding of the potential challenges that may arise from using theological terminology in non-religious discussions. However, the response could have been strengthened by providing more specific examples or references to Christian teachings on forgiveness, repentance, and reconciliation in the context of interpersonal violations within a church community. Overall, a solid effort with room for further depth and development."
