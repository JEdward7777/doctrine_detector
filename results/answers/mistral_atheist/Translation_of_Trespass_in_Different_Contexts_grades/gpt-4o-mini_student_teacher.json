  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough analysis of the implications of translating 'trespass' as 'sin' or 'breaking the rule' within a church context, considering cultural, linguistic, and theological perspectives. The student effectively demonstrates critical thinking and understanding of the potential impact on individuals within the church community. The response aligns well with the concern of ensuring scriptural integrity and community values. However, the student could strengthen their answer by directly addressing the spiritual consequences and moral impact on community harmony, as emphasized in the reference answer."
