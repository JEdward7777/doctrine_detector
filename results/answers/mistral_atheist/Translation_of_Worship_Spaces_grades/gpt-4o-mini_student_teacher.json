  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student provided a thoughtful response and accurately conveyed the meaning of the phrase \"house of Yahweh\" in a culturally respectful and contemporary context. They appropriately connected the phrase to its historical significance in the Hebrew Bible and expanded on its broader meaning beyond just a physical structure. However, the student's translation could have been more direct in emphasizing the presence of Yahweh, as indicated in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the concept and its importance in worship spaces.\n\n"
