 In a culturally respectful and contemporary context, the phrase "House of Yahweh" could be translated as "Temple of God" or "God's Sanctuary." This phrase is found frequently in the Hebrew Bible, referring to the central place where Yahweh was worshiped by the Israelites. The original concept encompasses not just a physical structure but also the community and religious practices associated with it. In contemporary times, this could be understood as the spiritual or metaphorical "House" where people gather to worship and seek connection with their faith's deity.
