  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 80.\n\nThe response shows a good understanding of the biblical context and provides thoughtful alternative translations for the phrase \"You must call his name.\" The student demonstrates knowledge of the original languages and cultural nuances of the time, which is important when interpreting biblical texts.\n\nHowever, to improve the grade, the student could have further delved into the theological implications of naming in a biblical context. They could have explored how names in the Bible often carry significant meanings or foreshadow events, reflecting God's sovereignty and plan. Additionally, a stronger connection to the overarching theme of God's authority and purpose in naming individuals in the Bible would have strengthened the response."
