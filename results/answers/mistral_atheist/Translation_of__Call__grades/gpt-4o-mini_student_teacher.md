## [Answer](../Translation_of__Call_.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In a biblical context, the phrase "You must call his name" appears several times, most notably in Genesis 2:23 and 17:5, where it refers to naming a newly created being or a covenant.

In terms of alternative translations, given that the original texts are written in ancient Hebrew (Genesis) and Aramaic (in the case of Jesus's naming), it is essential to consider the cultural and linguistic nuances of the time. Here are some variations based on different interpretations:

1. "You shall give him a name": This translation emphasizes the active role humans play in bestowing identity upon the new being.

2. "Name him thus": This version underscores the specific naming instruction that follows, suggesting a clear and unambiguous designation.

3. "He is to be called by this name": This interpretation highlights the importance of the chosen name and its significance.

4. "Let his name be as follows": This translation stresses the significance of the name being given, often symbolizing attributes or prophecies about the person or object being named.

5. "His identity is to be known as such": By focusing on the idea of identity and recognition rather than just a name, this version acknowledges the deeper implications associated with naming in ancient Hebrew culture.
