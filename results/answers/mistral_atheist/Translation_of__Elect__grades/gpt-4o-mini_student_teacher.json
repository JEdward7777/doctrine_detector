  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-explained comparison between older and modern English Bible versions regarding the translation of 'elect' and its impact on understanding Scripture. They touch on theological implications and offer specific examples from both types of translations. While their analysis is thorough, deducting some points for not directly addressing the teacher's reference answer which emphasizes the distinction between 'chosen ones' in the Old Testament and 'elect' in the New Testament impacting one's understanding of their identity as God's people. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic and presents a thoughtful response."
