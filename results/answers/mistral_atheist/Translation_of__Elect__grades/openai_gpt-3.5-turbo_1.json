The explanation is clear and well-supported with examples from specific Bible verses. The answer effectively addresses the concern by discussing the different translations and their implications on the concept of being chosen by God. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of God's election and predestination in the context of being chosen by God, to provide a more comprehensive Christian worldview perspective."
