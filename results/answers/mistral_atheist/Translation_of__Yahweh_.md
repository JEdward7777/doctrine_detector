## Question [Translation of 'Yahweh'](../../questions/Translation_of__Yahweh_.md)
Why do some churches prefer to use 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' in translations?

Some churches prefer 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' to maintain traditional translation practices, which respect the original Hebrew text while making it accessible to congregations.

## Concern to grade by
This raises questions about the importance of using original names of God versus cultural practices.

## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The usage of 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' in many English translations is a common practice due to cultural and linguistic reasons, rather than theological ones. This convention dates back to the 16th century King James Version (KJV) of the Bible.

The Hebrew word for God, Yahweh, was transliterated as 'Jehovah' in older English Bibles. However, it was perceived as awkward and difficult for English speakers, so the KJV translation committee opted to use the title "LORD" (in all capital letters) when translating Yahweh's name.

The intention behind this choice was to maintain the respect due to God while providing a more readable translation for their readers. The practice of using 'LORD' has been continued in many modern English Bible translations as it is easier for contemporary readers to understand and pronounce compared to 'Yahweh'.

This does not mean that churches necessarily prefer one term over the other, as both 'Yahweh' and 'LORD' refer to the same divine entity. However, the use of 'LORD' in translations is a way to make the Bible more accessible for modern readers while preserving the reverence due to God.
