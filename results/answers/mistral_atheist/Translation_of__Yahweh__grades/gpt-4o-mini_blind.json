  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the historical and linguistic reasons behind the use of 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' in English translations of the Bible. The student accurately explains the transition from 'Jehovah' to 'LORD' in the King James Version and the continued use of 'LORD' for readability purposes. However, the explanation could have been strengthened by emphasizing the theological significance of God's name and the reverence associated with it. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview and the importance of accurately reflecting God's identity in translations could have been included."
