  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-detailed explanation of why 'LORD' is preferred over 'Yahweh' in church translations, considering both cultural and linguistic factors. However, the answer could have further emphasized the importance of maintaining reverence towards the original names of God from a Christian worldview perspective, which the reference answer highlighted. The student's response lacked a clear connection to the significance of using the original names of God versus cultural practices, which is essential in a Christian-specific worldview."
