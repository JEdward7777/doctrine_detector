  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the historical, linguistic, and practical reasons behind the usage of 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' in English translations of the Bible. It acknowledges the tension between maintaining the original names of God and making the text accessible to modern readers. The response successfully addresses the concern by highlighting the balance between respecting cultural practices and upholding the original Hebrew text while making it understandable to congregations."
