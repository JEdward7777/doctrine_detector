It effectively addresses the concern about the importance of using the original names of God versus cultural practices by highlighting the balance between maintaining the respect for the divine entity and making the text accessible to modern readers. However, it could have further emphasized the theological significance of God's name and the potential impact on the understanding of His character when using different names."
