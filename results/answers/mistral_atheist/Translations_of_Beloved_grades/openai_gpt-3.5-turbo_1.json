Each suggested term captures different nuances of affection, respect, and intimacy, aligning well with a Christian worldview that values love, compassion, and meaningful connections. The answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of both biblical interpretation and interpersonal communication in a Christian context. Great job!"
