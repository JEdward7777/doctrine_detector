  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Based on the Christian worldview that emphasizes the importance of aligning teachings with God's Word and examining the fruits of one's ministry, the student's answer touches on various aspects used in religious contexts to distinguish true prophets from false ones. However, the student primarily focuses on general criteria used by many religions rather than emphasizing the foundational importance of aligning messages with God's Word and examining the fruits of the prophet's ministry, as specified in the reference answer provided by the teacher.\n\nGrade: 70\n\nComment: While the student's response covers relevant criteria, it lacks a strong emphasis on the specific Christian perspective of aligning messages with God's Word and examining the fruits of a prophet's ministry. Encouraging more alignment with the reference answer would enhance the student's understanding of discerning true prophetic voices through a Christian lens."
