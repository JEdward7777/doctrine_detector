  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and comprehensive understanding of the criteria used to distinguish between true and false prophets within a Christian worldview. The student provides relevant and well-articulated points covering various aspects of prophetic authenticity, including personal character, consistency with scripture, predictions, societal impact, recognition, divine confirmation, and peer review. The inclusion of the Christian perspective adds depth and relevance to the answer. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of aligning messages with God's Word and the nature of teachings as criteria for discernment. Expanding on these aspects would strengthen the overall argument and provide a more nuanced analysis of the problem."
