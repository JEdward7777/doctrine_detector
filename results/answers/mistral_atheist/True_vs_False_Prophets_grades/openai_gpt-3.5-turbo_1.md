 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations; my purpose is to help you explore ideas based on various perspectives, including but not limited to religious texts and scholarly works. In the context of your question, let's look at some common criteria used in many religions to distinguish between a true prophet and a false one:

1. Authenticity: A true prophet is expected to live according to the teachings they bring forth. Their personal character and actions should reflect the message they preach. Hypocrisy or immoral behavior would cast doubt on their authenticity.

2. Consistency with established scriptures: If a prophet's teachings are consistent with existing religious texts, it may be seen as evidence of their truthfulness. However, this can be subjective and may depend on how the texts are interpreted.

3. Predictions and fulfillment: Some religions believe that true prophets have supernatural abilities to predict future events. If a prophet's predictions come true over time, it could support their claim as a true prophet.

4. Impact and transformation: A true prophet should inspire change in the hearts and actions of people. They should promote peace, justice, and compassion, leading to positive societal transformations.

5. Recognition by religious leaders or communities: In some cases, acceptance from religious authorities or the wider community might be seen as evidence of a prophet's legitimacy. However, this can also be problematic, as power dynamics within religions may influence such recognition.

6. Divine confirmation: Some religious traditions believe in signs or miracles as proof of a prophet's claim. These can include healing the sick, performing extraordinary feats, or receiving direct revelations from God.

7. Peer review: Many faiths have historical records or processes for evaluating claims made by would-be prophets to ensure their teachings align with established beliefs and values. This helps maintain consistency within the religion over time.
