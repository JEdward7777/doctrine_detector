However, the response lacks depth and specificity in applying a Christian perspective. It briefly mentions aligning with God's Word, teachings, and ministry fruits, which are key aspects in discerning true prophetic voices in Christianity. To improve, the answer could have delved deeper into biblical examples, such as referencing Matthew 7:15-20 (about recognizing false prophets by their fruits) or 1 John 4:1-3 (about testing the spirits). More explicit integration of Christian teachings would enhance the response from a Christian worldview standpoint."
