## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 From a philosophical perspective, both hope and a wish can be seen as states of desiring something to occur, but they differ in their underlying assumptions and qualities.

A wish is a simple desire or longing that lacks the element of expectation or belief that it will actually happen. It's more like a hope without any basis or plan. For example, when someone wishes upon a star, there's no real belief or expectation that their wish will come true; it's more of an expression of desire.

Hope, on the other hand, involves a stronger sense of belief and expectation. It implies that there is some basis for believing that what is hoped for might actually happen. In religious contexts, hope in God often involves believing that God has the power to bring about what is hoped for, and that it aligns with God's will or character.

So, hope in God goes beyond mere wishing, as it involves a belief in a higher power who can make a difference and an expectation that what is hoped for might actually come to pass due to this belief. It's important to note that this interpretation applies to religious contexts; the distinction between hope and wishing may not be as clear-cut in non-religious contexts.
