  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and thoughtful analysis of the difference between hope in God and merely wishing for something. The student effectively distinguishes between the two concepts, with a specific focus on the belief and expectation inherent in hope, particularly in the context of faith in God. The response shows a good understanding of the theological aspect and effectively communicates the Christian worldview on the topic. Great job!"
