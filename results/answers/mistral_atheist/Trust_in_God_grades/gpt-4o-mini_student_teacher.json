  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a well-reasoned explanation distinguishing between hope and wish from a philosophical perspective, highlighting the differences in belief and expectation. However, the student's answer lacks a clear emphasis on the importance of trust and faith in God when discussing hope in a Christian context. They do acknowledge the religious aspect of hope in God but could have integrated the teacher's reference answer more directly into their response to align it with a Christian worldview."
