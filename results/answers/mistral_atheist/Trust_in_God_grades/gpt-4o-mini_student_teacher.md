## Question [Trust in God](../../../questions/Trust_in_God.md)
How does having hope in God differ from merely wishing for something?

## Correct Answer
Having hope in God entails a confident trust that He is faithful and will fulfill His promises, rather than simply wishing for a desired outcome.

## Stated Concern
Distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking.

## [Answer](../Trust_in_God.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 From a philosophical perspective, both hope and a wish can be seen as states of desiring something to occur, but they differ in their underlying assumptions and qualities.

A wish is a simple desire or longing that lacks the element of expectation or belief that it will actually happen. It's more like a hope without any basis or plan. For example, when someone wishes upon a star, there's no real belief or expectation that their wish will come true; it's more of an expression of desire.

Hope, on the other hand, involves a stronger sense of belief and expectation. It implies that there is some basis for believing that what is hoped for might actually happen. In religious contexts, hope in God often involves believing that God has the power to bring about what is hoped for, and that it aligns with God's will or character.

So, hope in God goes beyond mere wishing, as it involves a belief in a higher power who can make a difference and an expectation that what is hoped for might actually come to pass due to this belief. It's important to note that this interpretation applies to religious contexts; the distinction between hope and wishing may not be as clear-cut in non-religious contexts.

Grade: 75

Comment: The student provides a well-reasoned explanation distinguishing between hope and wish from a philosophical perspective, highlighting the differences in belief and expectation. However, the student's answer lacks a clear emphasis on the importance of trust and faith in God when discussing hope in a Christian context. They do acknowledge the religious aspect of hope in God but could have integrated the teacher's reference answer more directly into their response to align it with a Christian worldview.
