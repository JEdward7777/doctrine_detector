  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the difference between hope and wishing, specifically within a religious context. \n\nThe student accurately highlights that hope in God involves a confident expectation based on a belief in God's faithfulness and fulfillment of promises, while a wish is simply a desire with no basis or expectation of success. \n\nThe response also acknowledges the distinct nature of hope in religious contexts, aligning it with God's character and will. \n\nWhile the answer is well-written and comprehensive, it could benefit from further elaboration on the nature of God's faithfulness and the basis for confident expectation in the context of hope."
