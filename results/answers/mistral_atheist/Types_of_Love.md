## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Bible, the Greek language uses several words to express various forms of love. The most commonly referenced is "Agape," which is often translated to mean selfless, unconditional love. This form of love is emphasized as a fundamental commandment in Christianity and is used to describe God's love for humanity and Christians' love for one another (John 13:34-35, Galatians 5:13).

The other forms of love mentioned in the Bible include "Philia," which refers to brotherly or friendly love, and "Storge," familial affection. In the New Testament, these terms are sometimes used interchangeably with Agape.

Romantic love is not explicitly defined in the Bible, but it can be inferred from passages discussing marriage (Genesis 2:24, Ephesians 5:25). The relationship between husband and wife is emphasized as a reflection of God's love for his people and a symbol of Christ's love for the church.

In this context, all forms of love can be seen as expressions of the command to love one another as oneself (Mark 12:31). This means treating others with kindness, empathy, and respect, regardless of whether it is familial, platonic, or romantic in nature. It's important to note that interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations and individuals, and the Bible itself does not provide a clear-cut definition for each specific type of love.
