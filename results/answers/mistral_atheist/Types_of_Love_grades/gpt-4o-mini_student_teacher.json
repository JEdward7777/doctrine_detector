They also acknowledge the varying interpretations among Christian denominations on the specific definitions of love. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of aligning all forms of love with the principles of God's love, as highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, a stronger conclusion connecting all forms of love to the overarching theme of God's command to love one another as oneself would have enhanced the response."
