It also correctly notes that romantic love is not explicitly defined but can be inferred from passages discussing marriage. However, the response does not fully address the concern of differentiating between types of love while ensuring they align with a biblical worldview.\n\nThe response could improve by providing more nuance in its explanation of how each form of love relates to God's love and commandment to love one another as oneself (Mark 12:31). Additionally, it would be helpful to provide specific examples of how each type of love should be expressed in practical ways that align with biblical principles.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the different forms of love mentioned in the Bible, but could benefit from more development on how these types of love relate to God's love and commandment."
