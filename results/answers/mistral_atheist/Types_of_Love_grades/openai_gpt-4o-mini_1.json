  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the different forms of love presented in the Bible and how they align with a biblical worldview. It emphasizes the importance of all forms of love reflecting God's principles of care and commitment. The only slight improvement could be in providing more direct references to specific Bible verses that support the concept of different forms of love aligning with biblical principles. Overall, a very strong response."
