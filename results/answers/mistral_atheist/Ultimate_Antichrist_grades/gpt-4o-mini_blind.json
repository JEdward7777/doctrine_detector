The response fails to acknowledge the theological significance of the Antichrist in Christian belief and downplays its importance by approaching it from an atheistic and purely historical/literary perspective. From a Christian worldview, understanding the Antichrist is crucial for believers in terms of eschatology and spiritual warfare, and the answer lacks that depth of insight."
