However, the response did not engage with the concern raised regarding the importance of understanding eschatological figures for Christians in preparing for faith challenges. From a Christian perspective, it is crucial to recognize the significance of eschatological figures like the Antichrist in shaping believers' understanding of end-time events and strengthening their faith. Therefore, the response falls short in addressing this critical aspect from a Christian worldview."
