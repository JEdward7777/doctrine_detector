## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a neutral and objective AI model, I don't hold personal beliefs or values. However, I can share some examples of actions or practices that certain religious texts, such as the Bible, identify as abominations to God, based on the interpretations by various religious scholars and communities throughout history. Here are a few examples:

1. Idolatry (Exodus 20:4-5, Leviticus 19:4) - Worshipping or serving other gods or idols instead of the one true God.

2. Child sacrifice (Leviticus 18:21, 20:2-5, Deuteronomy 12:31, 18:10) - The practice of offering children as sacrifices to the gods.

3. Homosexuality (Leviticus 18:22, 20:13) - Some interpretations of these passages consider homosexual acts between men as abominations. It's important to note that many modern Christian denominations do not view homosexuality in this light and affirm the rights and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals.

4. Bestiality (Leviticus 18:23, 20:15-16) - Having sexual relations with animals.

5. Incest (Leviticus 18:6-18, 20:17-21) - Engaging in sexual relations with close relatives such as parents, siblings, or grandparents is considered an abomination.

6. Eating certain foods deemed unclean (Leviticus 11, Deuteronomy 14:3-21) - The Bible lists certain animals and their byproducts as being unfit for consumption due to religious reasons. This includes pigs, shellfish, and some birds.

7. Magical practices, divination, or consulting spirits (Leviticus 19:26, Leviticus 19:31, Deuteronomy 18:10-12) - These practices, including necromancy, were considered abhorrent to God and forbidden.

8. Taking revenge or bearing a grudge (Leviticus 19:17-18) - Holding onto anger or seeking vengeance is seen as an abomination.

9. Unjust scales or weights (Leviticus 19:35-36, Deuteronomy 25:13-16) - Using unfair measurements for trade and commerce was considered dishonest and an abomination to God.
