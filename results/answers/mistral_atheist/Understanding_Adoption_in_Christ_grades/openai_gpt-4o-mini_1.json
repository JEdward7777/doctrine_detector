The response should have emphasized the aspect of being chosen and predestined by God for adoption, highlighting the unique relationship believers have with God as their Father. Additionally, the reference to being co-heirs with Christ could have been expanded upon to showcase the spiritual blessings and inheritance received through this adoption."
