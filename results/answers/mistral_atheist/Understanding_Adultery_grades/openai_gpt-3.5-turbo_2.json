  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of how the Bible addresses adultery, covering both Old and New Testament perspectives and emphasizing the spiritual and relational consequences of adultery on marriage and spirituality. It effectively utilizes relevant scriptures to support the discussion and offers insights into the Christian perspective on the topic. The only minor improvement could be further elaboration on how adultery specifically impacts the covenant between husband and wife, but overall, the response is well-researched and insightful."
