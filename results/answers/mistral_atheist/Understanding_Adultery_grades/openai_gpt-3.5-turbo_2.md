## [Answer](../Understanding_Adultery.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The Bible, specifically the Old Testament and the New Testament, both discuss the consequences of committing adultery. In the Old Testament, Leviticus 20:10 states, "If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man who committed adultery with the woman and the woman herself are to be put to death." However, it is important to note that in Jewish law, capital punishment for adultery was rare and usually applied only when the circumstances were aggravated.

In the New Testament, Jesus upholds the Mosaic Law, but in Matthew 5:27-28, he expands upon the commandment against adultery in the context of his Sermon on the Mount: "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."

Regarding consequences, Proverbs 6:32-33 says, "Whoever commits adultery lacks sense; he who does so destroys himself. Wounds and dishonor he will get, and his reproach will not be wiped away." In addition, Exodus 20:14 states that adultery is one of the Ten Commandments, emphasizing its significance in Jewish law and morality.

It's important to remember that interpretations of the Bible can vary greatly among different religious groups and individuals. This response provides a general overview based on traditional Christian understandings of the Bible.
