However, the answer could have further emphasized the Christian perspective by highlighting the belief that when Christians say 'Amen' at the end of a prayer, they are affirming their agreement with the prayer and expressing their trust that God will fulfill the requests or intentions presented in the prayer. Additionally, referencing specific biblical teachings or examples related to the use of 'Amen' in Christian prayers would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
