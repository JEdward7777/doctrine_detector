In these contexts, 'Amen' is often used to express agreement, confirmation, or assent with what has been said during a prayer or blessing. It signifies the fervent wish that the words spoken are true and will indeed be fulfilled. The use of 'Amen' at the end of a prayer can also indicate unity and collective commitment among the community of believers to uphold the principles or intentions expressed within the prayer.
