  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85. \n\nThe answer provides a solid explanation of the concept of being 'appointed to eternal life' in a Christian context, referencing relevant biblical passages and core beliefs. The student correctly states the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for securing eternal life and touches on the contrasting concept of 'eternal death.' However, the response could have been strengthened by diving deeper into the biblical basis for the concept of being appointed to eternal life and the implications of this belief for Christian theology. Additionally, while acknowledging differing interpretations is important, the student could have provided more clarity on the mainstream understanding of this doctrine."
