  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a clear and well-explained answer that aligns with the Christian concept of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation. The response effectively links the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" with faith in Jesus Christ and explains the eternal consequences of this belief. However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing more explicitly the aspect of divine selection and the sovereign will of God in bestowing this gift of eternal life, as highlighted in the reference answer."
