  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does touch on the idea that being \"appointed to eternal life\" reflects God's sovereign will and grace, which is in line with the concern about divine selection and grace in salvation. However, the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation.\n\nOne area for improvement is that the response doesn't explicitly connect the concept of appointment to eternal life with faith in Jesus Christ, as mentioned in the original passage. Additionally, while it touches on the idea of God's sovereignty and grace, it could delve deeper into how these concepts relate to the Christian doctrine of salvation.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good starting point for understanding the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life,\" but could benefit from further development and connection to relevant biblical passages."
