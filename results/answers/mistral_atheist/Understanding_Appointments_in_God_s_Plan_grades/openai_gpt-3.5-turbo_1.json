The integration of relevant biblical passages and the explanation of contrasting beliefs regarding eternal life and eternal death add depth to the answer. The response effectively addresses the concern by framing the concept within the context of God's sovereign will and grace. Overall, this is a strong and well-supported explanation from a Christian worldview."
