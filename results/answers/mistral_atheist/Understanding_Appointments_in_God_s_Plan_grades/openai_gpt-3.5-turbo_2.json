  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context, emphasizing God's sovereign will and grace in the process of salvation. It aligns well with the Christian worldview by highlighting the belief in divine selection and grace as central to understanding eternal life. The inclusion of scriptural references and the explanation of the contrasting concept of \"eternal death\" further enhances the clarity and depth of the response. Overall, it effectively addresses the concern within a Christian perspective."
