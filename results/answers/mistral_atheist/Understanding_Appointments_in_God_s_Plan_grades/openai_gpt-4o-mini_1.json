  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a strong explanation within a Christian worldview of being 'appointed to eternal life' as reflecting God's sovereign will and grace in granting the gift of eternal life. The explanation is clear and aligns well with Christian theology regarding divine selection and grace in the context of salvation. The discussion on eternal life, eternal death, and ongoing debate within Christian communities adds depth to the explanation. Overall, a well-supported and insightful response."
