  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 70.\n\nThe answer provides a clear explanation of the differences between believing in something and believing someone, touching upon aspects of cognition, perception, and trust. The distinction between faith in ideas and trust in individuals is well articulated. However, from a Christian perspective, the answer falls short in acknowledging the ultimate importance of faith in God and belief in Jesus Christ as central tenets of Christian belief. It also leans towards secular reasoning rather than incorporating the spiritual dimension of belief in God. A more thorough integration of Christian doctrine and theology into the response would have improved the grade."
