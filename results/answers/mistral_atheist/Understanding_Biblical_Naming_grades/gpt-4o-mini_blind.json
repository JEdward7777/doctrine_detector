  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The student provided a well-reasoned and thoughtful explanation of the significance of naming in the Bible. They correctly highlighted the connection between a name and its meaning, particularly in the context of the name John meaning \"God is gracious.\" The response could have been strengthened by including more specific biblical references that support the interpretation given. Additionally, emphasizing the spiritual significance of names in Christianity and how they reflect God's nature and purpose for individuals would have further enriched the explanation."
