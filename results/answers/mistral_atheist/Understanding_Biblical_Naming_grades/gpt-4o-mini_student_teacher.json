  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the significance of names in biblical context, considering the cultural and religious beliefs of the time. However, the concern was focused on proper biblical interpretation and the significance of names in scripture. The student's response, while informative, did not directly address the specific concern outlined. A more focused and concise answer based on the reference answer would have been more appropriate."
