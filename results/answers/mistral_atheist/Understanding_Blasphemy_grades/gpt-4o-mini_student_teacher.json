  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid overview of the biblical implications of blasphemy by referencing Exodus 20:7 and Matthew 12:31-32. They appropriately mention the importance of understanding historical and cultural contexts for accurate interpretation. However, the response could be improved by incorporating more specifics on the seriousness of blasphemy and its impact on relationships with God and others, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
