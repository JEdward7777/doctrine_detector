They provided relevant examples from both the Old and New Testaments to support their explanation. However, the mention of being an atheistic scholar and how these concepts can impact societal values and ethics, regardless of personal belief, detracts from the Christian-specific worldview approach. It is important to focus solely on the Christian perspective when discussing Biblical concepts."
