  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the Biblical concept of 'bonds' in relation to spiritual obligations and relationships with God. The student provides clear examples from scripture to support their claims and acknowledges the significance of these bonds in understanding spiritual growth and role in God's plan. However, the student's atheist perspective and inclusion of comments regarding societal values and ethics slightly detracts from the strictly Christian-specific worldview of the prompt."
