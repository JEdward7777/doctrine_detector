They correctly highlight the cultural context and the distinction between ritual regulations and moral codes. However, the response could be improved by delving deeper into the specific biblical passages and teachings on cleanliness and moral purity, connecting them more explicitly to Christian doctrines of sin, redemption, and sanctification. Additionally, the student could have emphasized the ultimate fulfillment of moral purity through faith in Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit in transforming believers. This would strengthen the theological foundations of the argument."
