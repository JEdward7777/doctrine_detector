  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 80.\n\nWhile the student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the historical and cultural context of the Biblical definitions of 'clean' and 'unclean', as well as their implications for moral purity, there is a lack of emphasis on the spiritual aspect of cleanliness as a symbol of moral purity. The student's answer is well-written, thoughtful, and covers various aspects of the topic, but it could be improved by focusing more on the spiritual significance of cleanliness as observed in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Emphasizing the spiritual aspect would align more closely with a Christian worldview perspective."
