  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the passages from 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16, discussing the concepts of condemnation, forgiveness, and reconciliation. However, the student could have more explicitly connected the contrast between condemnation and grace in the Christian life, as outlined in the reference answer. The student's explanation would be stronger with a clearer emphasis on the role of Christ in overcoming condemnation through belief in Him."
