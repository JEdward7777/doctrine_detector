  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical passages and clearly articulates the contrast between condemnation and grace in the Christian life. They accurately summarize the main points of both passages and provide relevant contextual information. However, the response could benefit from additional elaboration on the specific concepts of condemnation and grace in Christianity, particularly in relation to the student's Christian specific worldview."
