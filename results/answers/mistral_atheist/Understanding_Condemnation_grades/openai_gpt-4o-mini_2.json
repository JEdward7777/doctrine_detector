  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively captures the Christian perspective on condemnation and grace as taught in the Bible, providing a solid explanation of the passages mentioned and their implications for believers. The student does well in addressing the concern raised and demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of condemnation and grace within the Christian worldview. The response could be strengthened by explicitly linking the concept of condemnation and grace to the passages cited and by providing more specific biblical references to support the explanation."
