  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"unclean spirit\" in relation to demons in Christian teachings. They accurately conveyed the concept of spiritual impurity and the influence of these evil supernatural beings on individuals. However, they also appropriately acknowledged the limitations of religious interpretations in contrast to scientific perspectives on mental health. The grade is slightly lower than perfect as the answer could have been more concise and focused specifically on the Christian worldview without introducing scholarly debates."
