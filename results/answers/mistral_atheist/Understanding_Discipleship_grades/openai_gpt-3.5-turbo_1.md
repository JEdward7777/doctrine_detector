# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 According to the provided content, which primarily comes from the New Testament of the Christian Bible, being a disciple of Jesus means to follow his teachings and example closely. A disciple of Jesus is someone who believes in him as the Son of God and Messiah (Savior), accepts his teachings, and strives to live according to them. This includes love for others, compassion, forgiveness, humility, and living a moral life. A disciple also acknowledges Jesus' sacrifice on the cross for the salvation of humanity.

In practical terms, a disciple of Jesus is expected to:

1. Love God above all else (Matthew 22:37-38)
2. Love one's neighbor as oneself (Matthew 22:39)
3. Follow the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12)
4. Obey Jesus' commands, such as forgiving others, praying, and being a witness for him (John 14:15, John 15:12-17, Matthew 28:19-20)
5. Strive to live a holy life, abstaining from sin and following the moral teachings of Jesus (Matthew 5-7, Galatians 5:22-23)
6. Share the Good News of salvation through Jesus Christ with others (Mark 16:15, Acts 1:8)
