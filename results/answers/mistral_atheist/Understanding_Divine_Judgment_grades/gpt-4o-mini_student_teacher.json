  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that effectively addresses the concern of understanding the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. The response incorporated relevant biblical texts and themes to highlight the differences between God's judgment and human judgment in a clear and coherent manner. The student's explanation is insightful and aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of God's righteousness, justice, and mercy in judgment. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more direct references to the specific biblical passages mentioned in the teacher's reference answer to further enhance the integration of scriptural support."
