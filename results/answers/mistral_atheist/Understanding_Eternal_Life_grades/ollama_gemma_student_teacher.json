  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the biblical teachings regarding inheriting eternal life from a Christian perspective. It accurately explains the central role of faith in Jesus Christ, the importance of grace, and the need for repentance and forgiveness. However, it does not explicitly address the teacher's concern about inheriting eternal life through obedience to God's laws. While the connection between obedience and eternal life is implied in the student's response, it would have strengthened the answer to include a more direct statement regarding the importance of obedience in attaining eternal life according to Christian beliefs."
