However, the specific answer given \u2013 \"The Bible teaches that eternal life can be inherited by obeying God's laws and having faith in Him\" \u2013 lacks some depth and nuance. While obeying God's laws and having faith are important aspects, salvation in Christianity is ultimately based on faith in Jesus Christ as the savior and the grace of God, rather than simply obeying laws. It is essential to clarify and emphasize the centrality of Jesus Christ in the attainment of eternal life for a more comprehensive understanding."
