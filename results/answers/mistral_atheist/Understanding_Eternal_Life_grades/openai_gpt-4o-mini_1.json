However, the given answer that eternal life can be inherited by obeying God's laws and having faith in Him is incomplete. While obedience to God's laws is important, it is faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior that is the central means of inheriting eternal life according to Christian doctrine. Understanding this distinction is crucial for spiritual assurance in the Christian faith."
