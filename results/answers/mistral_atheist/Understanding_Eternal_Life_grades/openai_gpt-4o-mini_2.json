However, the concern raised regarding the importance of understanding how to attain eternal life being through obeying God's laws and having faith in Him is not fully addressed in the response. The response does not specifically mention obedience to God's laws as a means of inheriting eternal life, which is a significant aspect of Christian belief. It would have been beneficial to include a more direct reference to the role of obedience to God's laws in the process of attaining eternal life within the Christian faith."
