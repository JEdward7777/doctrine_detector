  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and nuanced explanation of how the Bible distinguishes between 'evil' and 'wickedness' in terms of moral character and behavior. The student has shown a good understanding of the distinctions between the two concepts and how they are used in biblical teachings. The student's answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher and effectively addresses the concern of ensuring clarity on the moral implications of behaviors and character in the context of biblical teachings. Great job!"
