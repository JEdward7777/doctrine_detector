## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In a cultural context, the term "faithless" generally implies that a person does not hold or practice religious faith, specifically in the belief in a higher power or deity, such as God. However, it's essential to clarify that this term is often subjective and can vary across cultures, religions, and individuals. In a more absolute sense, an atheist, who explicitly denies the existence of a deity or gods, could be considered "faithless" in terms of traditional religious faith. It's important to note that being 'faithless' does not necessarily equate to a lack of moral values, ethics, or spirituality, as these can be found in various non-theistic philosophies and humanist beliefs.
