  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a fair analysis of the term \"faithless\" in a cultural context and acknowledges that it can vary across individuals and belief systems. However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of highlighting the significance of faith in moral conduct. The response does not effectively emphasize the link between faith and morality, focusing more on the broader understanding of faithlessness. To improve the grade, the response should more directly address the importance of faith in shaping moral values and behavior."
