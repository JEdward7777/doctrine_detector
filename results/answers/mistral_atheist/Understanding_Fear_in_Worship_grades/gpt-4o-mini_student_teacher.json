  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the two main types of fear in the Bible - fear of God and fear of man. They correctly highlight the importance of understanding fear in the context of reverence and awe towards God, which aligns well with the biblical perspective. Additionally, they contrast this with the common understanding of fear in everyday life. The only minor improvement would be to further emphasize that biblical fear is primarily focused on worship and respect towards God."
