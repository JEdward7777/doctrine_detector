  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of how the Israelites' perception of Gentiles influenced their relationships in the early church. It accurately highlights the initial biases and gradual evolution of attitudes towards Gentiles within the Jewish Christian community. The reference to key biblical passages, such as Acts 10-11 and Acts 15, demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. However, to improve the grade, the response could have included more specific references to Paul's teachings and actions in relation to Gentiles, as his efforts were crucial in bridging the cultural gap between Jews and Gentiles in the early church."
