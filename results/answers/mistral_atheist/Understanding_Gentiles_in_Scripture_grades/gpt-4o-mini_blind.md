## [Answer](../Understanding_Gentiles_in_Scripture.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Early Church, the relationship between Jewish Christians (the Israelites) and Gentile Christians was significantly influenced by the longstanding cultural perceptions and religious traditions within Judaism. The Old Testament provided strict guidelines for interactions between Jews and non-Jews (Gentiles). This dichotomy is reflected in the New Testament where we see a gradual evolution of attitudes towards Gentiles, driven primarily by the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles, as well as the expanding missionary efforts.

Initially, the Jewish Christians held strong cultural biases against the Gentiles due to their perceived spiritual impurity and adherence to different moral laws. This is evident in Acts 10-11, where Peter has a vision instructing him to accept the Gentile Cornelius as worthy of hearing the Gospel message. Similarly, in Acts 15, a major debate arises regarding whether Gentile converts needed to follow Jewish laws such as circumcision. This led to the issuance of the Council of Jerusalem's decree, which provided a compromise solution that allowed Gentiles to join the Church without requiring them to adopt all the Jewish customs and laws.

Throughout the New Testament, we see examples of this changing relationship between Jews and Gentiles, with figures like Paul actively working towards breaking down these cultural barriers by ministering to both groups and emphasizing the universality of the Gospel message in his epistles. This evolution of attitudes towards Gentiles in the Early Church demonstrates a significant shift in religious and cultural perspectives driven by the teachings of Jesus, the Apostles, and the broader missionary efforts.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of how the Israelites' perception of Gentiles influenced their relationships in the early church. It accurately highlights the initial biases and gradual evolution of attitudes towards Gentiles within the Jewish Christian community. The reference to key biblical passages, such as Acts 10-11 and Acts 15, demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. However, to improve the grade, the response could have included more specific references to Paul's teachings and actions in relation to Gentiles, as his efforts were crucial in bridging the cultural gap between Jews and Gentiles in the early church.
