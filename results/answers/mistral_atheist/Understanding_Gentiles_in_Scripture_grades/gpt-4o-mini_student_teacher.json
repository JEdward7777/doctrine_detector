  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that effectively outlined the historical context of Jewish-Gentile relationships in the early church and demonstrated an understanding of the evolution of attitudes towards Gentiles. The response effectively highlighted key events such as Peter's vision and the Council of Jerusalem to support their points. However, the student could have further emphasized the spiritual implications of these cultural barriers being broken down and the significance of unity within the church in line with a Christian worldview perspective."
