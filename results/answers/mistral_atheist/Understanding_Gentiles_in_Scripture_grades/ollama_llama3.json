The discussion of Acts 10-11 and 15 is particularly relevant to the topic and effectively illustrates the changing attitudes towards Gentiles.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly addressing the concern about the challenges in relationship and fellowship within the early church as these barriers were being broken down. While the response mentions the \"cultural barriers\" and the need for a \"compromise solution,\" it does not fully explore the implications of these historical events on the unity of the Church.\n\nThe provided answer is generally consistent with the main ideas presented in the response, but there are some nuances that could be explored further. For example, while it is true that the Israelites traditionally viewed Gentiles as outsiders who could never be God's people, this perspective was not universally held among all Jewish groups. The response could benefit from a more nuanced exploration of these complexities.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the historical context of Jewish-Gentile relationships and their implications for the church's unity, but could be strengthened with additional analysis and nuance."
