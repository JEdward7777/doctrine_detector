It effectively expands on the initial answer by delving into specific biblical examples and the evolving attitudes towards Gentiles, highlighting the role of key figures like Peter and Paul. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview in examining how cultural barriers were addressed through the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles. It effectively addresses the concern by linking the historical context to its implications for the church's unity."
