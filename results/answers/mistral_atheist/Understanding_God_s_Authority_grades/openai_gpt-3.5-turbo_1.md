# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 The title "The Most High" (Hebrew: אֱלֹהִים עֵלְיונִים, Elohim 'elyōnīm) appears frequently in the Hebrew Bible, particularly in the Book of Daniel. It is often used to denote a supreme deity or ultimate authority, emphasizing divine power and sovereignty beyond that of any other gods or earthly rulers.

In a non-theistic context, we might interpret this title as symbolizing an ideal or abstract concept of ultimate authority, one that transcends human understanding or control. It could represent a moral compass guiding our lives, a universal principle of justice, or a powerful force for positive change. This interpretation recognizes the historical and cultural significance of the term without necessarily attributing supernatural qualities to it.

In either case, "The Most High" serves as a reminder of the need for humility in the face of power beyond our comprehension, whether that be a deity or an abstract concept of ultimate authority. It emphasizes the importance of striving towards justice, righteousness, and understanding in our lives to align with this higher power, whatever it may be.

Grade: 75

Comment: The response provides a solid understanding of the significance of the title "Most High" in relation to God's supreme authority and greatness. However, the concern about believers struggling to comprehend the implications of God's sovereignty in their personal lives is not fully addressed in the response. While the interpretation presented is respectful and acknowledges the cultural significance of the term, it does not offer a clear Christian perspective on how believers should approach and grapple with the idea of God's sovereignty in their daily lives. Therefore, the deduction in the grade reflects the incomplete addressing of the concern from a Christian worldview.
