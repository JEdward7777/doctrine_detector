## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In a culturally respectful and academically rigorous response, I would say that the statement in the Bible where God is said to call humans by name refers metaphorically to a profound sense of relationship and personal connection between God and individuals. This is not meant to imply a literal act of calling out a person's name, but rather an intimate bond established through covenant or faith.

In various passages throughout the Bible, such as Genesis 3:9, Exodus 3:4, Isaiah 43:1, and many others, the phrase "God called by name" is used to signify God's initiative in forging a relationship with humans. This concept is deeply rooted in the Hebrew understanding of God as a personal and relational deity who desires a connection with His people.

In essence, this metaphor helps convey that God knows us intimately, cares for us individually, and wants us to respond to Him in faith and obedience. However, it is essential to understand that interpreting such texts requires careful consideration of their cultural, historical, and literary contexts, as well as a deep respect for the complexities of religious belief and tradition.
