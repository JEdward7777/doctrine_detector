  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of the metaphorical significance of God calling people by name in the Bible. The student demonstrates an understanding of the cultural and historical context, as well as the importance of a personal relationship with God. The response could be enhanced by explicitly mentioning the significance of naming in ancient Near Eastern cultures and how that adds depth to the metaphor. Overall, a solid and respectful explanation."
