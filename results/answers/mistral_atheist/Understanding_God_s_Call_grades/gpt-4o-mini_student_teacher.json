  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated explanation of the concept of God calling individuals by name in the Bible, emphasizing the symbolism and metaphorical nature of the phrase. The response thoroughly explored various biblical passages and the theological implications of this calling. While the student's interpretation focused on the personal and relational aspect of God's call, they did not directly address the specific concern of understanding the personal relationship and intention God has towards individuals as explicitly stated in the reference answer. The explanation could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting God's calling by name to His personal knowledge, care, and purpose for each individual. Further engagement with the specific concern would have enhanced the overall response to align more closely with the Christian worldview."
