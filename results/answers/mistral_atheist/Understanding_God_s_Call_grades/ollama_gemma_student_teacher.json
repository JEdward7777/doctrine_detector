Additionally, they acknowledge the importance of considering the cultural, historical, and literary contexts of the texts, as well as respecting the complexities of religious belief and tradition.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific implications of God calling individuals by name, particularly in relation to their purpose and destiny."
