The answer touches on the notion of divine guidance and purpose, which are key elements of being called by God. However, the response could be improved by including more specific references to biblical passages that support the idea of divine calling and by emphasizing the importance of prayer, discernment, and obedience in responding to God's call. Additionally, a stronger connection could be made to the idea of surrendering one's will to God's will in discerning and following a calling."
