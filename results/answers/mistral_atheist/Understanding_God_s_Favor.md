## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 According to the New Testament of the Christian Bible, Jesus demonstrated favor with God primarily through his life's mission: living a sinless life as a human being, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies, and most significantly, dying on the cross for the sins of humanity. This act is seen as an ultimate demonstration of love and obedience to God, which earned him God's favor.

As for men, Jesus demonstrated favor in various ways. He taught with authority, healing the sick, casting out demons, feeding the hungry, and showing compassion to the marginalized and outcasts of society. This drew people to him, demonstrating his favor among men. The miracles he performed were seen as signs that he was sent from God, further strengthening this belief.

However, it's important to note that interpretations can vary greatly among different Christian denominations and individuals. This summary is based on a broad, general understanding of the New Testament narratives about Jesus.
