  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The student has provided a well-detailed and accurate comparison between God's glory in the Bible and worldly sources of glory. The answer effectively highlights the differences in origin, nature, and lasting impact between the two concepts. The biblical references used are appropriate and support the points made. However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly acknowledging the importance of aligning one's pursuit of glory with God's will and acknowledging the need for humility in seeking true glory. Overall, a solid analysis with room for slight improvement in theological depth."
