The explanation is grounded in biblical references and emphasizes the importance of understanding this distinction for proper worship. The response could have further emphasized the eternal and unchanging aspect of God's glory in comparison to the temporal nature of worldly glory, but overall, it aligns well with a Christian worldview."
