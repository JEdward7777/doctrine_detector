The student effectively articulates the eternal, unchanging nature of God's glory compared to the temporal and fragile nature of worldly glory. The response also stresses the fulfillment and deeper connection with the divine that seeking God's glory brings, in contrast to the potential emptiness and disillusionment of pursuing worldly glory. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview on the concept of God's glory."
