  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive overview of seeking God's will from both a theistic and atheistic perspective, acknowledging different belief systems. However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on aligning decisions with what is pleasing to God as revealed in Scripture, which is essential in a Christian worldview. The response could benefit from greater emphasis on the importance of discerning and following God's specific guidance through prayer, Scripture study, and seeking wisdom from spiritual leaders."
