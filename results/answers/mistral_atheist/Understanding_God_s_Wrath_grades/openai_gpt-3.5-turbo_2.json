  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the difference between God's wrath and human anger, emphasizing that God's wrath is a measured response to sin and not a fit of rage. The discussion aligns well with the concern provided, displaying a solid understanding of the concept from a Christian worldview. The response could have been strengthened by incorporating more scriptural references to support the argument and deepen the analysis further."
