  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"grace\" in a Christian context, emphasizing its undeserved nature and God's mercy towards humanity. The answer also appropriately touches on the concepts of salvation and the empowering aspect of grace for believers. However, the student's response could be improved by focusing more on the aspect of grace as God's unmerited favor specifically towards sinful humanity, as highlighted in the reference answer."
