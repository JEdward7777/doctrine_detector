  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of grace in a Christian context. It accurately describes grace as undeserved favor, kindness, and mercy from God, emphasizing its central role in salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. Additionally, the student correctly highlights the enabling power of grace for believers to live a holy life. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the freely bestowed nature of grace, aligning more closely with the reference answer."
