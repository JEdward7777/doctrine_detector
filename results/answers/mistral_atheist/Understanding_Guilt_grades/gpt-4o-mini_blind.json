However, the answer could be improved by delving deeper into the theological implications of guilt, such as the innate sinful nature of humanity, the necessity of a savior, and the role of grace in redemption. Additionally, connecting Old Testament sacrificial practices more directly to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ would strengthen the explanation."
