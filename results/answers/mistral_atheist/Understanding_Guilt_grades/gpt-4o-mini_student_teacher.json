  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-rounded answer that captures the biblical understanding of guilt as a violation of God's commands and the resulting separation from Him. They also mentioned the importance of repentance, forgiveness, and the atonement provided by Jesus Christ. However, the answer could have been strengthened by focusing more directly on the specific definition given in the reference answer provided by the teacher. By emphasizing the aspect of moral wrongdoing and disobedience to God in their response, the student could achieve a higher grade."
