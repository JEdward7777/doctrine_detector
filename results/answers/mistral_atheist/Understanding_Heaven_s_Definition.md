## Question [Understanding Heaven's Definition](../../questions/Understanding_Heaven_s_Definition.md)
What is the biblical definition of 'heaven' and how does it differ from 'sky'?

## Target answer from notes
In the Bible, 'heaven' usually refers to where God lives, while 'sky' refers to the blue expanse above the earth. The term 'heavens' encompasses everything above the earth, including celestial bodies like the sun and stars.

## Concern to grade by
It's essential to understand the different meanings attributed to these terms in Scripture, as they can impact our understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him.

## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a historian and scholar, I focus on providing accurate and culturally sensitive information about historical events, ideas, and beliefs, including those related to religion. In this case, we are discussing the concept of "heaven" within biblical contexts.

In Judeo-Christian traditions, the term "heaven" (Hebrew: שָׁמַיִם, shamayim; Greek: οὐρανός, ouranos) is used to describe a spiritual realm that is distinct from the physical world. It is often associated with God's dwelling place and represents the abode of the divine, where angels and other heavenly beings reside.

The concept of "heaven" in biblical literature differs significantly from the common understanding of "sky." The sky, or "firmament," is considered the physical dome that separates the Earth from the waters above (Genesis 1:6-8). It serves as a barrier and container for the Earth and holds the Sun, Moon, and stars in place.

In summary, while both terms refer to something above the Earth, they denote different realms – one being the physical sky (or firmament) and the other being the spiritual realm known as "heaven."
