  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe student's answer is generally accurate, correctly identifying that \"heaven\" typically refers to God's dwelling place in biblical contexts, while \"sky\" or \"firmament\" refers to the physical expanse above the earth. The additional clarification about \"heavens\" encompassing everything above the earth is also a good point.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples and supporting Scripture from the Bible. For instance, the student could have mentioned passages like Psalm 90:1-2 or Isaiah 66:1, which describe God's throne in heaven.\n\nThe concern is well-addressed in the response, as it highlights the importance of understanding the different meanings of these terms to gain a deeper understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him. Overall, this response demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical concepts surrounding \"heaven\" and their significance for Christian theology.\n\nComment: This response is strong overall, but could benefit from more specific biblical support and examples to further illustrate the points made."
