  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of how the concept of being an heir relates to the Christian understanding of receiving God's promises. The student effectively connects the metaphorical inheritance to salvation, eternal life, and various promises of God found in the Bible. The inclusion of scriptural references strengthens the answer's doctrinal correctness. However, to further enhance the response, the student could have elaborated on the implications of being an heir in terms of co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17) and the responsibilities that come with such an inheritance."
