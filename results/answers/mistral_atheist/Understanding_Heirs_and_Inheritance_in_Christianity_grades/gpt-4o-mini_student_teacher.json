  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that effectively explores the concept of being an heir in relation to the Christian understanding of receiving God's promises. The student references biblical passages and provides clear explanations, demonstrating a strong grasp of the topic. The answer aligns closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The only minor improvement could be to include a bit more personal reflection or application to deepen the analysis."
