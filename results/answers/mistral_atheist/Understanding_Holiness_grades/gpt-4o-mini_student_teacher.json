  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the concept of God's holiness across monotheistic traditions and emphasized the importance of striving for moral perfection in line with God's attributes. However, the response did not directly address the concern raised, which focused on reflecting on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God. The answer lacked a clear connection between God's absolute holiness and the implications for human sinfulness and the need for His allowance to approach Him. It would have been beneficial for the student to delve deeper into the implications of God's holiness on human sinfulness and the need for redemption through Jesus Christ, in a Christian-specific worldview."
