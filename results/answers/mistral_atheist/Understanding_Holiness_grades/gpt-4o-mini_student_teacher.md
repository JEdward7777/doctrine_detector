## Question [Understanding Holiness](../../../questions/Understanding_Holiness.md)
What does it mean for God to be absolutely holy, and how does that affect our relationship with Him?

God's absolute holiness means He is completely set apart from sin and imperfection, which indicates that we cannot approach Him without His allowance due to our sinful nature.

## Stated Concern
This question prompts reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Holiness.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In monotheistic religious traditions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the concept of a "holy" God refers to a deity who is absolutely perfect, pure, and morally good. This holiness is often associated with certain attributes like justice, love, wisdom, and righteousness. It's important to note that these qualities are idealized and abstract, as they are used to describe the nature of an omnipotent and transcendent being.

The idea of God's absolute holiness emphasizes that He is distinct from the world and its imperfections. This separation is a crucial aspect of religious belief, as it forms a basis for moral conduct and ethical behavior. The belief in a holy God encourages individuals to strive for moral perfection themselves, as they seek to emulate the divine qualities and come closer to this idealized being.

In terms of our relationship with an absolutely holy God, it is generally believed that we must approach Him with humility, reverence, and sincerity. Our actions, words, and thoughts should reflect a commitment to justice, love, and righteousness â€“ the qualities associated with His holiness. This relationship is often characterized by prayer, worship, and acts of obedience and devotion, as individuals seek to establish a connection with this perfect being and understand His will for their lives.

However, it's important to remember that interpretations of God's nature and our relationship with Him vary greatly among religious traditions and even within individual communities. The concept of an absolutely holy God can be deeply personal and subjective, and different individuals may have unique perspectives on how this holiness affects their beliefs and practices.

As a scholar without theistic leanings, I find it fascinating to observe how various cultural interpretations shape our understanding of divine holiness and its impact on human relationships.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the concept of God's holiness across monotheistic traditions and emphasized the importance of striving for moral perfection in line with God's attributes. However, the response did not directly address the concern raised, which focused on reflecting on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God. The answer lacked a clear connection between God's absolute holiness and the implications for human sinfulness and the need for His allowance to approach Him. It would have been beneficial for the student to delve deeper into the implications of God's holiness on human sinfulness and the need for redemption through Jesus Christ, in a Christian-specific worldview.
