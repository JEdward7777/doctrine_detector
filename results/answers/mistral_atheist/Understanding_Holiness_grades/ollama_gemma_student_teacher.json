  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concept of God's absolute holiness and its implications for our relationship with Him. \n\nThe student accurately explains the abstract nature of holiness as idealized and transcendent qualities associated with God in monotheistic traditions. They also highlight the importance of humility and reverence in approaching a holy God. \n\nThe inclusion of insights from a non-theistic perspective adds depth to the analysis, acknowledging the varying interpretations of divine holiness across cultures and traditions. \n\nHowever, the student could strengthen their response by further elaborating on the significance of Christ's redemption in reconciling humanity with a holy God. Additionally, the connection between God's holiness and personal transformation could be explored in more detail."
