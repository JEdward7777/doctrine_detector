  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of the concept of God's absolute holiness within monotheistic traditions and how it influences human behavior and relationships. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the need for humility and recognition of our sinful nature when approaching a holy God. The inclusion of various perspectives and the acknowledgment of subjective interpretations add depth to the discussion. However, deducting a few points for not explicitly stating the necessity of God's allowance for approaching Him due to our sinful nature as highlighted in the provided answer."
