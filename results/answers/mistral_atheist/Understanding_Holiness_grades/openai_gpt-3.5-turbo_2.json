It appropriately addresses the concern by highlighting the idea that our sinful nature necessitates God's allowance for us to approach Him. The explanation aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of humility, reverence, and striving for moral perfection in our relationship with a holy God. The inclusion of various cultural interpretations adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could further emphasize the need for redemption and Christ's role in bridging the gap between sinful humanity and a holy God, to provide a more comprehensive Christian perspective."
