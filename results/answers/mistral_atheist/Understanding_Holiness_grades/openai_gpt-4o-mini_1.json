It accurately conveys the idea that God is set apart from sin and that we need His allowance to approach Him due to our sinful nature. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the need for reflection on our own holiness and the steps required to approach a holy God. However, it could have gone further by elaborating on the specific steps necessary for approaching a holy God, such as repentance, seeking forgiveness, and striving for righteousness through faith in Christ."
