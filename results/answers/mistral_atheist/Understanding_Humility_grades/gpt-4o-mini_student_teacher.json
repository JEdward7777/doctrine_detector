  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated response that captures the essence of humility before God according to the Christian perspective. They highlighted important aspects such as dependence on God, submission to His will, confession of sins, and a desire for a closer relationship with Him. While their answer was detailed and insightful, it slightly veered away from the concise definition provided in the reference answer. Overall, a commendable effort in addressing the concern with a Christian worldview."
