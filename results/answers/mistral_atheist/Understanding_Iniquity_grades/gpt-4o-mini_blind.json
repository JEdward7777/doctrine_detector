  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer at 80.\n\nThe student accurately highlights the traditional interpretations of the terms \"sin,\" \"iniquity,\" and \"transgression\" within a Biblical context. They provide clear definitions for each term and explain their nuances effectively. However, the student's response lacks a direct reference to specific Bible verses or passages which could have enhanced the explanation further. Additionally, the language could have been more assertive in presenting these distinctions as foundational within Christian doctrine. Overall, the answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic but could benefit from stronger scriptural support."
