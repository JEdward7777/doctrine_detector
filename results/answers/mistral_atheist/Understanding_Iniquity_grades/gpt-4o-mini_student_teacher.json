  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the biblical distinctions between sin, iniquity, and transgression within a biblical context. The student correctly highlights the nuances of each term and their implications in human wrongdoing. However, the teacher's reference answer emphasizes a slightly different perspective, focusing on iniquity as deliberate wrongdoing and sin as a broader category encompassing moral failings. The student's response aligns well with a scholarly understanding of the terms but could benefit from emphasizing the nuance between deliberate and unintentional wrongdoing, as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer."
