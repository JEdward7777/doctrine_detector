  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the terms sin, iniquity, and transgression within a Biblical context. The explanation given aligns well with Christian teachings and understanding. Understanding these distinctions can indeed help Christians recognize the seriousness of their actions and the need for repentance, as the concern rightly pointed out. Great job overall, with just a slight deduction for not explicitly tying the explanation back to the Christian worldview in the response."
