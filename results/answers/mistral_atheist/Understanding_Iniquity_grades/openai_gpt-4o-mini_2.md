## [Answer](../Understanding_Iniquity.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a helpful assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations; however, I can certainly explain the traditional interpretations of these terms within Biblical context as they are used across various books of the Bible.

1. Sin (Hebrew: Cheṭāʾ, Awōn; Greek: Hamartía): This term is often used in a broad sense to refer to any act that goes against God's will or nature, violating divine law. Sins can range from thoughts and feelings to actions and omissions.

2. Iniquity (Hebrew: ʻāwōn, ʿawûn; Greek: Anomía): This term is similar to sin but often carries the connotation of moral perversity or depravity, a persistent pattern of wrongdoing. It refers to a state of corruption that goes beyond individual actions and influences one's character.

3. Transgression (Hebrew: ḥāṭāʾ; Greek: Parábasis): This term is often used when referring to the violation of specific laws, especially those given by God. It carries the idea of crossing a boundary or going beyond what is allowed or acceptable.

These terms are not mutually exclusive and can overlap in usage, but they each offer unique perspectives on human wrongdoing as understood within Biblical literature. Keep in mind that interpretations may vary based on religious tradition and theological approach.
