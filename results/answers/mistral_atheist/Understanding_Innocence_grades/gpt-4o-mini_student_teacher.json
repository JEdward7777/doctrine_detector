  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns closely with the reference answer. They have accurately detailed the biblical understanding of innocence in the context of wrongful accusations and have referenced relevant biblical passages to support their points. The student effectively connects the concept of innocence to justice and mercy in Christian teachings. However, they could further strengthen their answer by directly stating that innocence implies being not guilty or deserving of punishment, as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
