It effectively addresses the concern by exploring how innocence relates to justice and mercy in Christian teachings. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further tie in the significance of mercy and forgiveness in the context of wrongfully accusing an innocent person, as these themes are central to Christian teachings on justice and grace."
