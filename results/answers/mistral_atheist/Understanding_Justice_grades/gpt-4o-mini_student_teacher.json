  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and detailed answer that successfully covers various aspects of acting justly according to \"God's laws\" across different religious traditions. The response effectively discusses key principles such as the Golden Rule, fairness and equality, honesty and integrity, caring for the needy, and forgiveness and mercy. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of aligning actions with God's specific laws and standards of righteousness as outlined in the Bible, with a clearer focus on the biblical standard of justice."
