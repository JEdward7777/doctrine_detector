These principles align well with the biblical standard of fairness and righteousness in our interactions with others. The integration of biblical references from the Old and New Testaments further strengthens the Christian worldview perspective on justice. The response effectively demonstrates how these principles can guide individuals in embodying God's love and fostering a more just and equitable society."
