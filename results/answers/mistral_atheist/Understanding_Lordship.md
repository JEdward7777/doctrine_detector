## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of the Christian Bible, particularly in the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible), "Lord" (Hebrew: Adonai; Greek: Kyrios) is a title used as a form of address for God. It emphasizes the idea of divine sovereignty and lordship over all creation. This is consistent with God's self-description in Exodus 3:14, where He identifies Himself as "I AM WHO I AM."

In the New Testament, this title is also used for Jesus on several occasions to express his divinity and authority. For example, in Matthew 28:18, Jesus says, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me," demonstrating His lordship as part of the Trinity.

So, in both instances, the term 'Lord' signifies a figure with supreme authority, power, and control over all creation, reflecting God's role as the Creator and Sustainer in Christian theology.
