It correctly highlights the significance of divine sovereignty, lordship, and authority associated with the title. The reference to Exodus 3:14 and Matthew 28:18 helps to support the explanation. However, it could be enhanced by including more scriptural references and delving deeper into the Trinitarian understanding of the term 'Lord' in Christian doctrine."
