  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of the term 'Lord' in relation to God and Jesus in the Bible. The student effectively explained the use of 'Lord' in both the Old and New Testaments to convey divine sovereignty, authority, and power. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by explicitly connecting the term 'Lord' to ownership or authority as a title for God and emphasizing the deity of Jesus when referred to as 'Lord Jesus' or 'Lord Jesus Christ', as highlighted in the reference answer."
