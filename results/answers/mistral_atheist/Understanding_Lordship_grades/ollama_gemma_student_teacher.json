It correctly highlights the idea of divine sovereignty and lordship over all creation, referencing relevant scriptures from both the Old and New Testaments. The connection between the title \"Lord\" and Jesus' divinity is clearly articulated. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the theological significance of \"Lord\" as ownership or authority, as suggested by the reference answer."
