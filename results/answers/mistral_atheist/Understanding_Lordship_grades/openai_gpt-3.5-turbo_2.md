## Question [Understanding Lordship](../../../questions/Understanding_Lordship.md)
What does the term 'Lord' signify in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible?

## Correct Answer
In the Bible, the term 'Lord' signifies ownership or authority and is used as a title for God. It communicates that Jesus is God when used in phrases like 'Lord Jesus' and 'Lord Jesus Christ.'

## Stated Concern
Understanding the significance of the term 'Lord' in relation to Jesus and God is crucial for recognizing their authority and divinity.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Lordship.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of the Christian Bible, particularly in the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible), "Lord" (Hebrew: Adonai; Greek: Kyrios) is a title used as a form of address for God. It emphasizes the idea of divine sovereignty and lordship over all creation. This is consistent with God's self-description in Exodus 3:14, where He identifies Himself as "I AM WHO I AM."

In the New Testament, this title is also used for Jesus on several occasions to express his divinity and authority. For example, in Matthew 28:18, Jesus says, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me," demonstrating His lordship as part of the Trinity.

So, in both instances, the term 'Lord' signifies a figure with supreme authority, power, and control over all creation, reflecting God's role as the Creator and Sustainer in Christian theology.
