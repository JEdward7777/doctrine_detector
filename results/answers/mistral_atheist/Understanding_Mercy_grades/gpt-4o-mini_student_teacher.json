  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out and comprehensive answer on how to demonstrate mercy in daily life, even without a belief in a divine being. The student's response emphasized universal values such as compassion, forgiveness, kindness, patience, humility, inclusivity, and empathy. However, the answer did not directly align with the concern of embodying the merciful nature of God. While the content is valuable and insightful, it would have been stronger if it specifically addressed how these actions are reflective of God's mercy as outlined in the reference answer."
