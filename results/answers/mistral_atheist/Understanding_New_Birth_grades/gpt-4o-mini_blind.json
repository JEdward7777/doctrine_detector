  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of what it means to be \"born again\" according to the Bible. The student accurately describes the spiritual rebirth that occurs through accepting Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, referencing key passages such as John 3:3. The emphasis on inner transformation, repentance, faith, and commitment to following Christ align well with Christian teaching. The student could improve by delving deeper into the theological significance and implications of being born again, but overall, this is a well-rounded and doctrinally sound explanation."
