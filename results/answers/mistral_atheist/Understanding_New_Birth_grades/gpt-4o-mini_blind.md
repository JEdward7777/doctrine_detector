## [Answer](../Understanding_New_Birth.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian theology, being "born again" refers to a spiritual rebirth or regeneration that occurs when a person accepts Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord. This concept is primarily discussed in the New Testament of the Bible, particularly in the Gospel of John (3:3) and the Epistles of Paul.

In John 3:3, Jesus tells Nicodemus, a Pharisee, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God." According to this passage, being born again signifies a spiritual transformation that allows a person to enter into God's Kingdom.

The idea of being born again emphasizes an inner change, a turning away from sin and embracing Jesus Christ as one's personal Savior. It is often associated with repentance, faith, and a commitment to follow Jesus Christ and His teachings. In many Christian denominations, this experience is marked by water baptism.

It's essential to note that the interpretation of biblical passages may vary depending on cultural, historical, and theological contexts. This explanation represents a general understanding of being born again in Christian theology.
