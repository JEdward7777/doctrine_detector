  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of being \"born again\" in Christian theology, referencing relevant biblical passages and emphasizing the spiritual transformation that occurs through accepting Jesus Christ as Savior. The answer aligns well with the reference answer, but could have been strengthened by focusing more on the specific aspect of moving from spiritual deadness to spiritual life in their explanation. Overall, a strong understanding and application of Christian doctrine."
