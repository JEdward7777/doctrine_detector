## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the New Testament, the concept of 'perishing' or 'eternal destruction' often refers to a spiritual state or fate rather than physical annihilation. It's important to note that interpretations can vary greatly among different Christian denominations and scholars.

Generally, 'perishing' is used to describe a state of separation from God and His grace, leading to spiritual death. This is contrasted with salvation or eternal life, which represents a relationship with God. For instance, in 2 Thessalonians 1:9, it states that those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might.

However, the specifics of this 'punishment' or 'eternal destruction' are often subjects of debate among scholars and believers, with some interpreting it metaphorically as a state of despair and loss rather than literal eternal torment. It is always advisable to consult multiple sources and engage in open dialogue when studying religious texts.
