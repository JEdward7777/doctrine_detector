  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-reasoned answer that aligns with the Christian worldview by discussing the concept of 'perishing' in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament. They have accurately explained the idea of separation from God due to lack of faith in Jesus for salvation. However, the answer could have been further strengthened by offering more specific biblical references supporting the definition provided in the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of the need for salvation through Jesus could have enhanced the Christian perspective in the response."
