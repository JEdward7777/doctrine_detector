They accurately explain that it refers to separation from God and highlight the contrasting concept of salvation. Additionally, they acknowledge the varying interpretations among denominations and scholars, demonstrating awareness of different perspectives. \n\nWhile the answer lacks specific examples from the New Testament beyond the reference in 2 Thessalonians, it provides a concise and well-articulated explanation of the concept. The inclusion of a mention about interpreting the punishment metaphorically adds nuance and demonstrates sensitivity to various interpretations."
