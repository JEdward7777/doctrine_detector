  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response generally aligns with the concern of exploring the implications of spiritual separation from God, correctly identifying that \"perishing\" spiritually means being lost or separated from God due to refusal to trust in Jesus for salvation. The added nuance of noting that different Christian denominations and scholars have varying interpretations is also relevant to the concern.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more specific examples of biblical passages that illustrate this concept, rather than simply stating it. Additionally, while the discussion of \"eternal destruction\" is tangential to the original concern, it does provide context for understanding spiritual separation from God.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept and its implications, but could benefit from further development and biblical support."
