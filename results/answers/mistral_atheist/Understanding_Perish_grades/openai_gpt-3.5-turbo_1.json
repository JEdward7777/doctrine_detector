It also addresses the concern raised by exploring the implications of spiritual separation from God, highlighting the consequences of such separation. The only improvement could be a bit more explicit mention of the ultimate consequence of eternal separation from God, which is typically understood as eternal damnation or punishment in Christian eschatology."
