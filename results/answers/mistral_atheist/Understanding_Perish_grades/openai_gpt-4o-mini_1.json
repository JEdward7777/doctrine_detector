It addresses the concern by discussing the implications of this separation, highlighting the idea of being lost and separated from the people of God. The response could have strengthened the discussion by further exploring the consequences of this separation in terms of eternal destiny or the importance of striving for reconciliation with God through faith in Jesus."
