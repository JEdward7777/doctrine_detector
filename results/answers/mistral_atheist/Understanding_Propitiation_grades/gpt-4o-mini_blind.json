However, from a Christian worldview, it falls short in recognizing the foundational belief in Jesus' sacrifice as a necessary atonement for sin, emphasizing divine wrath being appeased and reconciliation achieved through His death on the cross. It would be more appropriate to prioritize the theological significance of Jesus' sacrifice in propitiation, rather than solely focusing on historical and cultural contexts."
