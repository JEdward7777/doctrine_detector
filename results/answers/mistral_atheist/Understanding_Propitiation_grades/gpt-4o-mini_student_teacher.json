  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-researched and informative response regarding the concept of propitiation in the context of Jesus' sacrifice, emphasizing historical and cultural contexts. However, the student's answer veers off course by introducing atheistic perspectives and not explicitly addressing the concern of how propitiation relates to God's justice and mercy. While the student shows a good understanding of the historical and religious background, there is a lack of focus on the Christian-specific worldview in relation to propitiation."
