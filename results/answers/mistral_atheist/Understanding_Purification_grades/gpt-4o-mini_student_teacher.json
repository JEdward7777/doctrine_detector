However, the answer could have been improved by emphasizing the core aspect of purification in the Old Testament, which primarily relates to cleansing from ritual uncleanness and sin through animal sacrifices. While the student's response was detailed and insightful, a closer alignment with the teacher's reference answer would have enhanced the overall accuracy and depth of the explanation."
