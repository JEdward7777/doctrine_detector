It effectively addresses the concern by connecting the process of ritual purification to God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin. One minor improvement could be further elaboration on how purification rituals specifically demonstrate the separation of God's people from the surrounding nations and the moral implications of sin in relation to God's holiness."
