  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated and thoughtful explanation of God's righteousness, discussing aspects such as moral perfection, justice, integrity, and consistency in God's actions. However, the student missed the core Christian understanding that God's righteousness is tied to His absolute goodness, justice, faithfulness, and love, leading to the condemnation of sin. While the student's perspective adds depth to the discussion, it does not fully capture the Christian worldview on God's righteousness as referenced by the teacher's answer."
