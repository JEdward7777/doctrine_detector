## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian tradition, the title "Lamb of God" for Jesus is a reference rooted in both the historical context of ancient Judaism and the symbolic interpretations of the New Testament.

In the Old Testament, the Passover Lamb was a significant sacrificial animal. During the Exodus from Egypt, the Israelites were instructed to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doors with its blood to protect them from the Angel of Death (Exodus 12:3-13).

The symbolism of Jesus as the "Lamb of God" is found in several New Testament passages. For instance, John the Baptist refers to Jesus as such when he sees Jesus approaching (John 1:29): "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"

This title carries multiple layers of meaning:

1. Like the Passover Lamb, which protected the Israelites from harm, Jesus is seen as protecting humanity from spiritual death and sin through his life, death, and resurrection.
2. The lamb, being a gentle and meek animal, symbolizes innocence and sacrifice. Jesus, who was innocent of any wrongdoing, gave his life voluntarily to atone for the sins of humanity.
3. In Jewish sacrificial system, the Lamb (Agelia in Hebrew) was the specific offering made for sin (Leviticus 4:32-35). Jesus' sacrifice is seen as fulfilling that purpose.

In essence, the title "Lamb of God" reflects Jesus' role as the innocent victim who offered himself as a sacrifice to atone for humanity's sins and provide salvation. This interpretation is culturally rooted in the Old Testament sacrificial system but takes on new meanings within Christian theology.
