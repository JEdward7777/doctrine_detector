  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nThe student provided a detailed and well-explained answer that connects the Old Testament sacrificial system with the significance of Jesus being referred to as the 'Lamb of God' in the New Testament. They accurately referenced the Passover Lamb and John the Baptist's proclamation, and they effectively explained the symbolic meanings behind Jesus' sacrificial role.\n\nThe student also demonstrated an understanding of the multiple layers of meaning associated with Jesus as the 'Lamb of God' and how his sacrifice fulfilled the purpose of atonement for humanity's sins. The response accurately reflects Christian beliefs and theology surrounding Jesus' sacrificial role.\n\nOverall, the student's answer effectively addresses the concern raised and provides a thorough explanation supported by relevant biblical references."
