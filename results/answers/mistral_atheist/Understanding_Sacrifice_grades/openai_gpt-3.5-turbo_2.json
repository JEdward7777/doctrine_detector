The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption. The only minor improvement would be to explicitly mention how the sacrificial system in the Old Testament foreshadowed Jesus' ultimate sacrifice, further emphasizing the continuity and fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Jesus."
