It effectively connects the historical context of the Old Testament sacrificial system with the symbolic interpretations found in the New Testament. The answer aligns well with Christian beliefs about Jesus' sacrificial role in atoning for humanity's sins and providing redemption, addressing the concern regarding the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption from a Christian worldview."
