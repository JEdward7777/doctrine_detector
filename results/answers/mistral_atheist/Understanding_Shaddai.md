## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations. However, I can share information about various religious and cultural concepts based on research. The term 'Shaddai' appears frequently in the Hebrew Bible, particularly in the books of Genesis, Exodus, and Psalms.

The term 'Shaddai' is often translated as "Almighty" or "God Almighty." It's believed to be an epithet for God that emphasizes His power, sovereignty, and awe-inspiring nature. The exact meaning of Shaddai may not be definitively known due to the antiquity of the texts, but some suggest it could also relate to the breast or the mountains, underscoring God's provision and protection.

In the context of the Old Testament, 'Shaddai' is used in various situations where God demonstrates His power and authority. For example, in Genesis 17:1, God appears to Abraham as El Shaddai, making a covenant with him. In Psalm 28:3, David prays to Shaddai for deliverance from his enemies. Thus, Shaddai is invoked in contexts of both divine promise and protection, as well as judgment and wrath.
