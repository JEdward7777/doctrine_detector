  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student provides a detailed explanation of the term 'Shaddai' in the Old Testament, touching on its translation as \"Almighty\" or \"God Almighty\" and its associations with God's power and provision. However, the student's response lacks a Christian-specific worldview perspective and fails to incorporate key theological insights related to the term 'Shaddai.' Additionally, the assertion that the exact meaning of 'Shaddai' may not be definitively known overlooks the importance of understanding the term within its cultural and biblical context. Encouragement to deepen theological understanding and incorporate specific Christian theological perspectives when discussing biblical concepts would enhance the response."
