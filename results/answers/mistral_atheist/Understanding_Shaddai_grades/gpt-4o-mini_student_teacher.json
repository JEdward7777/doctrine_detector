  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75. \n\nWhile the student provided a good understanding of the term 'Shaddai' and its usage in the Old Testament, there was a lack of emphasis on the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. The student accurately discussed the meaning of 'Shaddai' as \"Almighty\" or \"God Almighty\" and provided relevant biblical references. However, the student could have further connected this term to God's divine attributes such as His power, sovereignty, and provision as revealed in Scripture. \n\nOverall, the student displayed a solid grasp of the topic but could have strengthened their response by incorporating more insights related to the nature and attributes of God."
