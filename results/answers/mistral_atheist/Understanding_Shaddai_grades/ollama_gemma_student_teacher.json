They provide a concise explanation of its possible origins and translations, while also highlighting its significance in various contexts. However, the grade could be improved by including more specific examples from the Old Testament to support the student's claims. Additionally, the student could have elaborated on the theological significance of 'Shaddai' within Christian theology."
