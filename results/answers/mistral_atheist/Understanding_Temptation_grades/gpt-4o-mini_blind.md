## [Answer](../Understanding_Temptation.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholarly figure who respects cultural context and historical accuracy, I would approach this question from the perspective of the biblical accounts of Jesus' life found within the New Testament. In the Gospel of Matthew (Chapter 4:1-11) and the Gospel of Luke (Chapter 4:1-13), we find the story of Jesus resisting temptations presented by Satan after his fasting for forty days and nights in the wilderness.

The strategies used by Jesus to resist these temptations can be summarized as follows:

1) Quoting Scripture: When Satan tempted Jesus with hunger during his fast, Jesus responded by quoting Deuteronomy 8:3: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God." Similarly, when Satan suggested that Jesus prove his divine identity by throwing himself off the temple, Jesus countered with another scripture reference - Deuteronomy 6:16: "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test." Lastly, when Satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world if he would bow down and worship him, Jesus responded by quoting Deuteronomy 6:13: "You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only you shall serve."

2) Staying true to his mission: Despite the temptations thrown at him, Jesus remained steadfast in his mission as the Son of Man (Matthew 4:17). He recognized that giving in to these earthly desires would deviate from his purpose.

3) Focusing on God's will: Throughout the temptation episode, Jesus demonstrated a clear understanding and prioritization of God's will over personal desires or immediate gratification. This focus allowed him to withstand Satan's attempts at manipulation and diversion.

4) Demonstrating self-control: In resisting these temptations, Jesus exhibited remarkable self-control, even when faced with intense physical need (hunger) and potential shortcuts towards power and glory. This discipline underscored his unwavering commitment to the path set before him.

5) Leaning on spiritual support: While battling Satan's temptations, Jesus relied on spiritual strength rather than earthly means. His resolve was bolstered by the knowledge that he had the support of God and the heavenly host (Matthew 4:11).
