  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful analysis of the strategies Jesus used to resist temptation, drawing directly from the biblical accounts in both Matthew and Luke. They accurately highlighted Jesus' use of scripture, staying true to His mission, focusing on God's will, demonstrating self-control, and leaning on spiritual support. The student's response showcased a deep understanding of the biblical narrative and effectively connected it to the broader theme of combatting temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ. However, the teacher's reference answer was a concise summary, focusing on the core elements of scripture and faith, which could have been given more weight in the student's response. Overall, the student provided a strong and well-supported answer that aligns with a Christian worldview."
