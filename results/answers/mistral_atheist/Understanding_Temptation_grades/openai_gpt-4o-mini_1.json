Each point is supported by references from the biblical accounts of Jesus' temptations in the New Testament. The explanation is clear, well-organized, and directly addresses the concern of understanding how to combat temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ from a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could be to further elaborate on how these strategies can be applied by Christians in their own daily lives."
