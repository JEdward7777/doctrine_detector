  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the relationship between trespass and sin in a Christian worldview. They effectively explained how trespass relates to both interpersonal violations and offenses against God, supported by references from the Bible. However, the student could improve by explicitly stating that all sins are considered trespasses against God, as emphasized in the reference answer. Nonetheless, the response shows a strong grasp of the concept and implications of trespass in connection to sin in Christian ethics."
