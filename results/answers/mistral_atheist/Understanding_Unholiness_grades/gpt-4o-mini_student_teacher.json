  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out response that addresses characteristics of an \"unholy\" life from a secular perspective, focusing on societal norms and moral principles. However, from a Christian worldview, the core essence of an \"unholy\" life is defined by rebellion against God and actions that dishonor Him. While the student's answer is insightful and relevant to identifying negative behaviors, it falls short of recognizing the spiritual dimension of unholiness according to Christian beliefs. Integrating this spiritual perspective would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview."
