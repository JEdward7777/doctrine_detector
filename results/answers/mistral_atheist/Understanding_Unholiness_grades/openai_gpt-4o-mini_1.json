It effectively encourages self-examination and awareness of behaviors that may go against moral and ethical principles. The focus on promoting values like compassion, honesty, responsibility, respect for human dignity, and intellectual curiosity aligns well with Christian teachings on leading a life that honors God and uplifts others. The incorporation of these values within a secular context demonstrates a thoughtful and holistic approach to addressing unholiness."
