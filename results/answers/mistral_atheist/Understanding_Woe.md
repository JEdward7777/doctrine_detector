## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of biblical warnings and judgments, the term 'woe' (often written as "Woe to...") is a prophetic or poetic expression of impending doom or divine condemnation, typically directed towards unjust or wicked people or nations. It signifies deep sorrow, distress, or lamentation over their actions and the consequences they will face due to their disobedience to God's laws or commands. The use of "woe" is common in both the Old Testament (Hebrew: אוהב, ohav) and the New Testament (Greek: οὐαι, ouai). In many cases, it's a call for repentance before God's wrath is unleashed upon them.
