The inclusion of references to the Old Testament and New Testament languages adds depth to the response. The only improvement could be further elaboration on the significance of 'woe' as a call for repentance and the importance of turning back to God to avoid the consequences of disobedience. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound explanation."
