  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the term 'woe' within the context of biblical warnings and judgments. They correctly identified 'woe' as a prophetic expression of impending doom or divine condemnation for unjust or wicked actions. The addition of discussing the call for repentance before God's wrath is unleashed shows a deeper understanding. However, the student could have emphasized more on the aspect of suffering as punishment for sins in order to align more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
