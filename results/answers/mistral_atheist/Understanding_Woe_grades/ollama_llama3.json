  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe student has correctly identified that \"woe\" signifies a feeling of great distress, which is accurate. They have also mentioned that it serves as a warning that people will experience suffering as punishment for their sins, which aligns with the biblical concept of judgment and condemnation.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or biblical references to support its claims. For instance, the student could have cited specific instances in the Bible where \"woe\" is used to warn unjust or wicked people of impending doom, such as Matthew 23:13-15 or Luke 11:42.\n\nOverall, while the response provides a good foundation for understanding the concept of \"woe,\" it could be more comprehensive and nuanced by incorporating more biblical insights and examples."
