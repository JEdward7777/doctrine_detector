## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Christian teachings, the term "worldly" typically refers to behaviors, beliefs, or values that are focused on or influenced by the material world, rather than spiritual or divine concerns. This concept is often associated with the Bible verses in 1 John 2:15-17 and James 4:4, where it is warned against loving "the world" (kosmos) or being "friends of the world," as such attachment can lead one away from God.

The behaviors and values that are often considered worldly in a Christian context may include an excessive focus on wealth, power, pleasure-seeking, fame, vanity, and a lack of concern for spiritual growth, service to others, or following God's commandments. Worldliness is seen as a form of idolatry, where one places more importance on temporal things than on the eternal relationship with God.

It is important to note that this interpretation can vary among different Christian denominations and interpretations of scripture. However, in general, within traditional Christian teachings, being worldly implies a lifestyle characterized by a lack of spiritual focus and an undue attachment to worldly things, which may lead one away from living according to God's will.
