  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of \"worldly\" within Christian teachings. It accurately describes the focus on material things rather than spiritual concerns and references relevant biblical passages. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific values and behaviors considered worldly in a Christian context. Additionally, the conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the concept of worldliness to the idea of opposing God's will."
