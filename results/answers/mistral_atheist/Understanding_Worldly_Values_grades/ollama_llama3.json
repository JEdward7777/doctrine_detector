  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response partially captures the essence of what it means to be \"worldly\" in a Christian context, but it lacks nuance and precision. While it correctly identifies some negative values and behaviors associated with worldliness, such as selfishness and ungodliness, it does not fully convey the concept's deeper implications.\n\nThe response also fails to acknowledge that worldly values can manifest in ways other than outright evil or corruption. The concern about understanding the contrast between worldly values and godly principles is not fully addressed in this response. To earn a higher grade, the response would need to provide more detailed explanations of what it means to be \"worldly\" in a Christian context, including its relationship to idolatry, spiritual growth, and God's will."
