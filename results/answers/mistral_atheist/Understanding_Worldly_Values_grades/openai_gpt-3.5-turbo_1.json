The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the contrast between worldly values (such as wealth, power, and pleasure-seeking) and godly principles, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing spiritual matters over temporal concerns. There is a strong connection to Christian teachings and a solid analysis of how being \"worldly\" is viewed within the context of a Christian worldview. Overall, an excellent response."
