However, from a Christian perspective, the answer misses the key element that true worship is directed towards the one true God. It also does not emphasize the aspect of surrendering one's heart, mind, and soul to God in worship. Additionally, while mentioning the diversity of beliefs is valid, it could be further clarified that for Christians, worship is centered on the triune God revealed in the Bible."
