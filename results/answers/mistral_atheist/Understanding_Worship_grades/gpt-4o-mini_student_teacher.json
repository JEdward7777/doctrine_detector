  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful explanation of the different contexts in which worship can occur, including secular and religious settings. However, the answer lacks a clear focus on the Christian perspective of worship as honoring, praising, and obeying God. To improve the grade, the student should incorporate more specifically Christian elements into their definition of worship."
