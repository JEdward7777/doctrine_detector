 In a secular context, 'worship' refers to the expression of extreme respect, admiration, or devotion towards someone or something considered as superior or sacred. This can be directed towards abstract concepts like freedom, love, or justice, or specific entities like nations, leaders, or ideologies. In religious contexts, worship is a practice that involves various forms of adoration, reverence, prayer, and ritual, typically aimed at a deity or deities.
