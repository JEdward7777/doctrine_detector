  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively defines worship in a Christian context as honoring, praising, and obeying God through specific actions. It aligns well with the concern of understanding worship in a Christian's life as reflecting their relationship with God. The response could have further elaborated on the spiritual aspect of worship and its centrality in Christian faith, which would have warranted a higher score."
