  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in both Jewish and Christian traditions, they focus more on the historical and cultural significance rather than on the deeper theological implications. The student accurately explains the term's symbolic nature and its association with Jerusalem and the people of Israel, which is commendable. However, the student could have delved deeper into how this metaphorical language reflects God's relationship with His people and the spiritual significance behind it, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer.\n\nTherefore, while the student demonstrates a good understanding of the term's usage and interpretation, there is room for improvement in connecting it more explicitly to the theme of God's affection and care for His people."
