  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and insightful response that effectively explains the metaphorical significance of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in Jewish and Christian traditions. They demonstrated a good understanding of the relationship between the metaphorical language used in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people. Additionally, they appropriately expanded on the initial answer by discussing the nuances of interpretation between Jewish and Christian perspectives. Great job overall, with only minor suggestions for improvement in further delving into the specific theological implications from a Christian worldview."
