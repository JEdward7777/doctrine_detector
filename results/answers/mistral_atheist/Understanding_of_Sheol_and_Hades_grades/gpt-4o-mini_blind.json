The explanation is clear and demonstrates an understanding of the topic. However, it could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the doctrinal teachings of the Bible regarding the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous in Sheol and Hades. Additionally, acknowledging the doctrinal implications of these concepts within Christian theology would add depth to the response."
