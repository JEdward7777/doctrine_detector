  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of highlighting the distinction between Sheol and Hades, and it provides specific examples from the biblical texts to support its points. The response also acknowledges the development of these concepts over time, which shows an understanding of the complexity of the issue.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more detail about the fates of the righteous and unrighteous after death. While it mentions that Hades is sometimes used interchangeably with Sheol in the Old Testament, it does not provide enough information to clarify how these concepts relate to the concern about understanding the distinction between the two fates.\n\nOverall, I would give this response a grade of 85 because it provides a good foundation for understanding the difference between Sheol and Hades, but could benefit from more development on the specific concern about the fates of the righteous and unrighteous after death."
