## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar, I strive to provide culturally respectful and historically accurate answers. In Christian tradition, Jesus Christ is often referred to as the "Cornerstone" in several passages of the New Testament, particularly Matthew 21:42 and Ephesians 2:20. The metaphor of a cornerstone holds significance as it symbolizes the foundation and structure of a building.

In the context of an assembly or community of believers, Jesus Christ serves as the central point upon which their faith is built. This idea is rooted in the Biblical passage from Isaiah 28:16, where it speaks of a cornerstone that was laid with care and will not be moved.

Jesus Christ represents the foundation of Christian teachings and values. His life, death, and resurrection are seen as the key events upon which the Christian faith is based. As the Cornerstone, Jesus Christ provides both spiritual and moral guidance for believers in their daily lives, helping them to construct a meaningful and righteous existence.

Furthermore, his teachings emphasize unity, love, forgiveness, and compassionâ€”principles that bind members of an assembly together as they strive to follow Jesus' example in their interactions with each other and the wider community. In this sense, Jesus Christ serves not only as a foundation but also as a unifying force that brings believers together.
