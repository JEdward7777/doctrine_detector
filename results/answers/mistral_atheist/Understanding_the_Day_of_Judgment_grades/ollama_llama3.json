  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response generally aligns with the correct answer, emphasizing Jesus' sinlessness, perfect character, and role as judge based on people's lives and relationship with Him. It also acknowledges the significance of Jesus' role in Christian tradition and culture.\n\nHowever, to achieve a higher grade, the response could have further developed the concept of Jesus as the judge, exploring the implications for believers and non-believers alike. The concern behind this question is to help believers reflect on the importance of their faith in Jesus and the implications of His role as judge. While the response touches on this, it could be expanded upon to provide a more comprehensive answer.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of Jesus as the judge, but could benefit from further elaboration to fully address the concern behind the question."
