The inclusion of relevant biblical references enhances the explanation. However, it would have been beneficial to emphasize the importance of Jesus as the ultimate embodiment of the House of God in the New Testament, as He is the true temple (John 2:19-21, Matthew 12:6). Additionally, incorporating the significance of the believer's body as the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19) could have further enriched the explanation."
