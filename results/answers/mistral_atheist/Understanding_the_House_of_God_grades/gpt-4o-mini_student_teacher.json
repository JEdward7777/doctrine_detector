  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the term 'House of God' in biblical context, acknowledging its representation as both a physical structure and a spiritual concept. However, the student could have emphasized the central theme of worship in relation to the 'house of God' and could have focused more on the specific significance of the tabernacle or temple in Scripture."
