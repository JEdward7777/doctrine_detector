  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 70.\n\nThe response starts off strong by accurately describing the biblical context of the phrase \"House of God\" as referring to a physical structure or temple for worship. It also correctly notes that the concept extends beyond just a physical building, symbolizing God's presence among his people or in individual believers. The inclusion of specific scriptural examples from Psalms and John's Gospel adds depth and support to this understanding.\n\nHowever, the response does not fully address the concern about clarifying the significance and meaning of \"House of God\" in Scripture. While it provides some biblical examples, it could be more nuanced in exploring the concept's implications for our understanding of worship, community, and individual faith.\n\nTo reach a higher grade (80-100), the response might benefit from further development of these themes and a more comprehensive discussion of how \"House of God\" relates to Christian practice and doctrine. As it stands, the response is solid but could be even stronger with additional analysis and insight."
