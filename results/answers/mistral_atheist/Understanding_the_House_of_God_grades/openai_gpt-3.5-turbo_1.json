  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance and meaning of \"House of God\" in Scripture, incorporating references from both the Old and New Testaments to support the interpretation. It effectively expands on the original answer by delving into the metaphorical and spiritual dimensions of the concept, showcasing a deep understanding of the biblical context. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the idea that 'God's House' extends beyond just a physical building, which could have been elaborated upon even more. Overall, a strong and insightful response grounded in a Christian worldview."
