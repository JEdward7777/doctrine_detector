It effectively clarifies that while the term can refer to physical structures like the temple, it also symbolizes God's presence among believers and the spiritual realm. Additionally, the use of relevant biblical references enhances the understanding of the concept. Great job in addressing the concern with a thorough and insightful analysis from a Christian worldview."
