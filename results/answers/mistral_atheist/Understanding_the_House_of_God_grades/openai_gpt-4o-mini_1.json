  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance and meaning of the term \"House of God\" in Scripture, expanding beyond just a physical building to include the presence of God among his people and within believers. The biblical references from both the Old and New Testaments support the argument effectively, showcasing a holistic understanding of the concept. The only minor improvement could have been a stronger tie-back to the original given answer at the end to ensure a seamless flow throughout the response. Overall, well-done in addressing the concern with a Christian specific worldview."
