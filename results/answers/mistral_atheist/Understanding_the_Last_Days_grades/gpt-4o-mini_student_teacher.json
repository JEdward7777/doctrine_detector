  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of the \"last days\" in a cultural and eschatological context but failed to align their response with the Christian worldview. The Christian-specific perspective on the \"last days\" emphasizes the timeframe between Jesus' first coming, His second coming, and the final judgment day, which the student did not address adequately. The importance of understanding this timeline in relation to Christian faith was not emphasized in the student's answer."
