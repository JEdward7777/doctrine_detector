The concern about understanding the timeline of major Biblical events is addressed effectively, highlighting the significance of these events for Christian faith. The only improvement could be to emphasize more explicitly the importance of aligning one's understanding of the \"last days\" with Biblical teachings and interpretations within the Christian tradition."
