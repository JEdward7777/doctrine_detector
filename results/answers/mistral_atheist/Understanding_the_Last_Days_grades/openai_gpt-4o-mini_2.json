However, it fails to directly address the specific concern about understanding the timeline of major Biblical events and their implications for Christian faith. The response could have been improved by explicitly connecting the concept of the \"last days\" to the timeline of major Biblical events such as Jesus' first coming, His second coming, and the final day of judgment."
