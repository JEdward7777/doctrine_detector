## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Name_of_God.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the Old Testament, the name Yahweh (יהוה) is one of the most significant and sacred names of God. It appears approximately 6,800 times throughout the Hebrew Bible. The exact etymology of "Yahweh" is unclear, but it is generally believed to derive from the Hebrew verb "Haya," meaning "to be."

The name Yahweh first appears in the Bible in Exodus 3:14 during Moses' encounter with the Burning Bush. In response to Moses' question about who he should tell the Israelites sent him by, God replied, "Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh," which is usually translated as "I Am Who I Am" or "I Will Be What I Will Be." This name emphasizes God's eternal and self-existent nature.

Throughout the Old Testament, Yahweh is depicted as the national God of Israel, who led the Israelites out of Egypt, established a covenant with them, and promised to be their protector and provider. The Hebrew people saw Yahweh as the one true God, distinct from the many other deities worshipped by surrounding cultures.

In Jewish tradition, the name Yahweh is considered so sacred that it is not spoken aloud during religious services. Instead, the substitute name "Adonai" (Lord) or "HaShem" (The Name) is used when reading the Hebrew Bible. This custom reflects the belief in the holiness and ineffability of God's name.

Overall, the name Yahweh signifies the unique relationship between God and the Israelite people, emphasizing their covenantal bond and the promise of divine protection and presence.
