  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a well-reasoned and detailed answer that effectively draws parallels between the Old Testament judges and Jesus Christ as the ultimate Savior in the New Testament. They have successfully highlighted the salvific purposes, divine appointments, guidance, and dealing with sin that both figures share. While the student's response is thorough and thoughtful, there could be a stronger emphasis on the eternal nature of Jesus' salvation compared to the temporary nature of the judges' deliverance. Additionally, the student could have tied their points more explicitly to the concern of grasping the continuity of the biblical narrative regarding salvation."
