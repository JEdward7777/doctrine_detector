  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough analysis of the biblical concepts of human spirit and evil spirit from a historical and cultural perspective. They have correctly highlighted the words used in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament to denote these entities. However, the student's response lacks clarity in connecting the personal spiritual identity with malevolent spiritual influences as requested in the concern. The teacher's reference answer succinctly addresses this distinction, which the student's response does not fully capture."
