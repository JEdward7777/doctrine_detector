  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer that encompasses various aspects of the tabernacle's significance for the Israelites. They correctly highlighted its role as a religious center, symbol of unity and identity, place of divine presence and guidance, facilitator of rituals and atonement, and site for judicial authority. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the historical and cultural context surrounding the tabernacle. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly emphasizing the importance of worshiping God as the primary purpose of the tabernacle, as stated in the reference answer."
