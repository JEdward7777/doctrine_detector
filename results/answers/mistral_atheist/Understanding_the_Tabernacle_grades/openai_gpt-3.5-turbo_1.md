# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar, I am not concerned with personal beliefs but rather with historical and cultural contexts. In the biblical account found in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, the Tabernacle (also known as Mishkan in Hebrew) served several significant purposes for the Israelites during their 40 years of wandering in the desert.

1. Religious Center: The Tabernacle was the primary religious center where God's presence dwelt among the Israelites. It provided a focal point for worship, offerings, and communicating with God. The design of the Tabernacle followed specific instructions given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai, emphasizing its sacredness and importance.

2. Unity and Identity: The construction and maintenance of the Tabernacle helped strengthen the Israelites' sense of unity as a people. It provided a common cause that bound them together, serving as a symbol of their unique identity as God's chosen nation.

3. Divine Presence and Guidance: According to the biblical account, the cloud of God's presence (Shekinah) would rest above the Tabernacle during the day, guiding the Israelites on their journey through the wilderness. At night, a fire would burn within the Tabernacle to provide light.

4. Ritual and Atonement: The Tabernacle housed various vessels, furniture, and articles used in religious rituals, such as the altar of burnt offering, the golden lampstand, and the Ark of the Covenant. These elements facilitated sacrifice, atonement, and purification, helping the Israelites maintain a right relationship with God.

5. Judicial Authority: The Tabernacle also served as a place for the administration of justice, as it housed the court of Aaron, the high priest, who acted as the mediator between God and the people.

In summary, the Tabernacle played a crucial role in providing religious, social, and political structure for the Israelites during their time in the desert. It served as a means to worship God, maintain unity, seek divine guidance, perform rituals for atonement, and uphold judicial authority.
