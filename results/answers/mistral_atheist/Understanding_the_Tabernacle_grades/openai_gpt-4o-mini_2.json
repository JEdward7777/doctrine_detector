The explanation is detailed and demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of the Tabernacle in facilitating the Israelites' worship and communication with God. The only slight improvement could have been to explicitly connect the Tabernacle's role in the Israelites' relationship with God to the broader theological concepts of covenant, holiness, and mediation, to provide a more explicitly Christian-specific worldview perspective."
