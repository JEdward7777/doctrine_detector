  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid overview of the significance of the title \"Son of Man\" in the context of Jesus' identity, referencing biblical passages and historical interpretations. However, the student's atheistic perspective starts to diverge from a Christian worldview towards the end of the response, leading to a lack of emphasis on the divinity of Jesus and the centrality of this title to Christian beliefs. A higher grade would be achieved by incorporating more explicitly Christian perspectives on Jesus as the Son of Man."
