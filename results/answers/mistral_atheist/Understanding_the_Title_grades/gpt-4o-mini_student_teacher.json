  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a solid overview of the biblical and cultural significance of the title \"Son of Man\" in relation to Jesus. However, the student's atheistic perspective and focus on scholarly debates detract from a Christian-specific understanding of Jesus' identity as fully human and fully divine. Additionally, the response lacked a clear emphasis on the implications for our faith, which is crucial in understanding the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' in a Christian worldview."
