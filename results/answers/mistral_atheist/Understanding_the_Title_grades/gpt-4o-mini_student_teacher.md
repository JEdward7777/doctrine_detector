## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Title.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of Jesus, the title "Son of Man" has both biblical and cultural implications. The phrase appears frequently in the Gospels, attributed to Jesus himself. It is derived from the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, particularly from Daniel 7:13-14, where an apocalyptic figure known as the "Son of Man" is described as a powerful, divine judge who will come to rule over humanity.

In Jewish literature of the Second Temple period (516 BCE – 70 CE), the Son of Man was often associated with a heavenly being or a messianic figure, but not explicitly connected to a specific human being like Jesus. In the New Testament, however, Jesus employs the term "Son of Man" to refer to himself in a way that suggests his divine authority and future role as a universal judge, interpreting it through the lens of Jewish messianic expectations and apocalyptic literature.

It is important to note that this interpretation is based on the New Testament's portrayal of Jesus, and there are various scholarly debates regarding the historical accuracy and authenticity of these texts. As an atheistic scholar, I am concerned with understanding how cultural and religious contexts influence the interpretation of texts like the Gospels, rather than making claims about the existence or divinity of Jesus himself.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a solid overview of the biblical and cultural significance of the title "Son of Man" in relation to Jesus. However, the student's atheistic perspective and focus on scholarly debates detract from a Christian-specific understanding of Jesus' identity as fully human and fully divine. Additionally, the response lacked a clear emphasis on the implications for our faith, which is crucial in understanding the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' in a Christian worldview.
