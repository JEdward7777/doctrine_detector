  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical and cultural significance of the title \"Son of Man\" in relation to Jesus' identity. The student provides a comprehensive analysis of the phrase's origins and interpretations in both Jewish and Christian literature. However, the inclusion of the atheistic scholar's perspective and the acknowledgment of scholarly debates regarding the historical accuracy of the New Testament texts adds nuance to the response and slightly lowers the grade."
