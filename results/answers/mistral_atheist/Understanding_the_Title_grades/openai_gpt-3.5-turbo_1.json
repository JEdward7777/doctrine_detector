However, the response from an atheistic scholar perspective lacks acknowledgement of the faith component inherent in interpreting Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man.' While the historical and scholarly debates are relevant, in the context of understanding its implications for faith, a Christian worldview would emphasize the belief in Jesus as the divine Son of God and the Messiah."
