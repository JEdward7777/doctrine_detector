  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the biblical and cultural implications of the title \"Son of Man,\" connecting it to Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine. However, the perspective of the atheistic scholar in the final paragraph detracts from addressing the concern of understanding the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' from a Christian worldview. The response acknowledges scholarly debates but does not delve into the implications for faith or the Christian understanding of Jesus' divinity. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to explore how the title 'Son of Man' relates to Jesus' role as the Messiah and what it means for Christians in terms of their faith and belief in Jesus as the Son of God."
