  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the title \"Son of Man\" in the context of Jesus, emphasizing His dual nature as fully human and fully divine, and highlighting His role as the Messiah and His connection to humanity. The explanation aligns well with the concern of understanding the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' and its implications for faith. However, the response does not explicitly address the Christian worldview or the theological aspects of Jesus' identity as the Son of Man. An additional connection to Christian beliefs and teachings would have strengthened the response further."
