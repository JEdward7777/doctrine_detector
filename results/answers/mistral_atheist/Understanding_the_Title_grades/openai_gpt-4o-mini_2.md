## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Title.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In the context of Jesus, the title "Son of Man" has both biblical and cultural implications. The phrase appears frequently in the Gospels, attributed to Jesus himself. It is derived from the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, particularly from Daniel 7:13-14, where an apocalyptic figure known as the "Son of Man" is described as a powerful, divine judge who will come to rule over humanity.

In Jewish literature of the Second Temple period (516 BCE – 70 CE), the Son of Man was often associated with a heavenly being or a messianic figure, but not explicitly connected to a specific human being like Jesus. In the New Testament, however, Jesus employs the term "Son of Man" to refer to himself in a way that suggests his divine authority and future role as a universal judge, interpreting it through the lens of Jewish messianic expectations and apocalyptic literature.

It is important to note that this interpretation is based on the New Testament's portrayal of Jesus, and there are various scholarly debates regarding the historical accuracy and authenticity of these texts. As an atheistic scholar, I am concerned with understanding how cultural and religious contexts influence the interpretation of texts like the Gospels, rather than making claims about the existence or divinity of Jesus himself.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the title "Son of Man" in the context of Jesus, emphasizing His dual nature as fully human and fully divine, and highlighting His role as the Messiah and His connection to humanity. The explanation aligns well with the concern of understanding the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' and its implications for faith. However, the response does not explicitly address the Christian worldview or the theological aspects of Jesus' identity as the Son of Man. An additional connection to Christian beliefs and teachings would have strengthened the response further.
