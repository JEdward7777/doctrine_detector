  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thorough response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the complexities of the Trinity within a Christian worldview. The student clearly articulates the core principles of the Trinity, including consubstantiality, relationship, and perichoresis. The response also acknowledges the mystery of the Trinity and encourages faith rather than logical explanation."
