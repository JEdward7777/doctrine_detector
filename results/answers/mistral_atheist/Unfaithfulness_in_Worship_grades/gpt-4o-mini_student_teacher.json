  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough and detailed explanation of how the people of Israel demonstrated unfaithfulness in their worship, citing specific instances from the Hebrew Bible. The examples given effectively illustrate different ways in which the Israelites strayed from God's commands. However, the student could improve their answer by focusing more on the central idea that unfaithfulness in worship primarily involved idolatry and following ungodly customs, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a commendable effort with room for a more focused approach."
