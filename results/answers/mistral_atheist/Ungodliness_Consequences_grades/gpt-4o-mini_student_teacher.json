The answer lacked a focus on the concept of judgment and wrath pronounced by God specifically on ungodly individuals as outlined in the reference answer. In a Christian worldview, it is crucial to emphasize the seriousness and consequences of rejecting God's ways and the ultimate separation from Him for eternity."
