 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations. However, I can share information about various religious texts that discuss divine consequences for unrighteous behavior. It's important to note that interpretations can vary widely among different communities and individuals.

In Christianity, the Bible (New Testament) states in Galatians 6:7-8: "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life."

In Islam, the Quran (Surah An-Nisa 4:169) says: "And whosoever does evil, cannot do it except to his own soul. For Allah is free from all imperfections and full of Wisdom." The hadith also mention that Allah says: "I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has ever seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined" (Bukhari 6527).

In Judaism, the Torah (Deuteronomy 11:13-17) states: "If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you today, and if you love and serve the Lord your God with all your heart and soul, your food and drink, and everything else you do, then you will prosper and be blessed."

These examples show that religious texts often emphasize that individuals' actions have consequences, but interpretations and specifics can vary significantly based on one's cultural context, personal beliefs, and the specific text or tradition being referenced.
