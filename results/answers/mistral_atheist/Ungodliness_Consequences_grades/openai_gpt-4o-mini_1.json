The inclusion of relevant texts from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism demonstrates a broad understanding of the theme of divine judgment and consequences across different faith traditions. The response could be enhanced by further elaborating on how individuals can seek redemption or avoid these consequences through repentance and aligning their lives with God's will."
