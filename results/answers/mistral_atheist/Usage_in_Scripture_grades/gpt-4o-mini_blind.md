## [Answer](../Usage_in_Scripture.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In both the Old Testament (also known as the Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament, the term "Holy One" is primarily used to refer to God or a divine being. The usage varies slightly between the two testaments due to their distinct narratives and cultural contexts.

In the Old Testament, the term "Holy One" (in Hebrew: קָדוֹשׁ - Qadosh) often appears in the context of God's unique identity, transcendence, and holiness compared to other gods or idols. For example, Isaiah 43:15, "I am the LORD, your Holy One, Israel's God, I declare and save; I give Israel in return for their captivity, Jacob for his descendants." Here, God is portrayed as the one true and holy deity who saves Israel from their captivity.

In the New Testament, the term "Holy One" (in Greek: ἅγιος - hagios) continues to emphasize God's holiness and sanctity but may also be used more specifically in reference to Jesus as the Holy One of God (e.g., Mark 1:24, "What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"). The term is also employed by early Christian disciples to describe themselves as sanctified followers of Christ (e.g., Acts 9:13, "Then Ananias answered, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' And at that very hour he regained his sight and was baptized").

In these contexts, the term "Holy One" serves to highlight the sacredness of God, Jesus, and believers, setting them apart from the ordinary world.

Comment: The response provides a solid overview of how the term "Holy One" is used in both the Old and New Testaments, correctly highlighting its significance in relation to God's holiness and uniqueness. The student effectively showcases the distinction between the usage of the term in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament and provides appropriate scriptural examples to support their points. However, to enhance the answer, the student could have delved deeper into the theological implications of how God's holiness is manifested through the term "Holy One" in both testaments, as well as elaborated more on the concept of believers being called holy in the New Testament.
