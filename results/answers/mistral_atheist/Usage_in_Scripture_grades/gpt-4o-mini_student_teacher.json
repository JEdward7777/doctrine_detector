  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and well-explained answer regarding the use of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments. They correctly highlight the significance of the term in both contexts and mention specific verses to support their explanation. However, the student could have further emphasized the divinity and authority of Jesus as seen in the New Testament, which was a specific concern raised in the grading criteria. Incorporating more references to passages that explicitly demonstrate Jesus as the 'Holy One' in the New Testament would have strengthened their response in addressing the concern provided."
