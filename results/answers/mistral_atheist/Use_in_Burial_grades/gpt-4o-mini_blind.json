  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the significance of myrrh in biblical times, particularly in the context of burial practices. The student effectively connects myrrh to both Egyptian embalming practices and Israelite religious rituals, citing relevant biblical references. However, the response could be improved by further emphasizing the theological symbolism of myrrh in the Christian context, particularly in relation to Christ's death and burial. Additionally, a deeper exploration of how myrrh was specifically used in burial practices within Israelite culture would enhance the response. Overall, a solid effort with room for theological depth."
