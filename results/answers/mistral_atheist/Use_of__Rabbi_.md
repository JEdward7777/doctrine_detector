## Answer given by [mistral atheist](../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 In Jewish society during the time of John the Baptist and Jesus, the title "Rabbi" was a term of respect and honor for learned teachers of Jewish law. It is important to note that the New Testament, which is a significant source of information about Jesus, is a Christian text and reflects a Christian perspective on these figures.

John the Baptist was not called Rabbi in any of the Gospel accounts, but he was recognized as a prophet or a voice crying out in the wilderness (Mark 1:2-3). This distinction may have been intentional to set him apart from the scribes and Pharisees who were the traditional Jewish teachers.

Jesus is called Rabbi in all four Gospels, often translating to "Teacher" or "Master." This title emphasizes his role as a teacher of God's word, but it should be noted that Jesus did not use this title for himself and often rejected the titles given to him by others (Matthew 8:4; Mark 10:17-18). Instead, he called himself "the Son of Man" or simply "I am."

In a culturally respectful and historically accurate context, it is essential to understand that the use of the title Rabbi for John the Baptist and Jesus reflects their roles as teachers in Jewish society but should not be taken as an endorsement or acknowledgement of their divine status within Judaism itself.
