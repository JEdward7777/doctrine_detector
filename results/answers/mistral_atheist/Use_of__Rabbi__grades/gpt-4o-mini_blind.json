  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: \n- The response provides a solid explanation of the title \"Rabbi\" and its significance in Jewish society during the time of John the Baptist and Jesus.\n- The student accurately distinguishes between John the Baptist and Jesus in terms of their use of the title \"Rabbi\" in the Gospels.\n- The student correctly notes Jesus' rejection of titles and his unique self-identifications.\n- The response could have been improved by including a more explicit emphasis on the divinity of Jesus from a Christian perspective and how it relates to his role as a teacher (e.g., highlighting Jesus as the ultimate Rabbi and Son of God).\n- Overall, a good response that demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
