  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-informed explanation of the cultural and historical context in which the titles \"Rabbi\" and \"Teacher\" were used for John the Baptist and Jesus. It correctly addresses the concern by acknowledging the respect and authority associated with their teachings. The response effectively integrates Christian worldview elements to assess the roles of John the Baptist and Jesus in relation to their titles as teachers. It could be strengthened by further emphasizing the divine authority of Jesus as the Son of God within Christian belief."
