  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the use of the title \"Rabbi\" for John the Baptist and Jesus in Jewish society during that time. The student correctly noted that Jesus was called Rabbi by his disciples, emphasizing his role as a teacher. The concern about recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings was adequately addressed. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the divine authority and uniqueness of Jesus as the Son of God within the Christian worldview."
