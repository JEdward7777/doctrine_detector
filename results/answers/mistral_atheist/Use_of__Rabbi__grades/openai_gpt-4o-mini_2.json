The explanation of how the title reflects their roles as teachers is well articulated, considering the concern about recognizing the respect and authority associated with their teachings. The Christian worldview is clear in acknowledging Jesus as the ultimate teacher, as he is referred to as \"Rabbi\" in the Gospels. The response could be enhanced by further connecting the respect and authority of their teachings to their divine status in Christianity."
