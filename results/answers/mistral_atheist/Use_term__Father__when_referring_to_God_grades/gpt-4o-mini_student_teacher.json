  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer acknowledges the importance of cultural sensitivities and inclusivity in language use, which is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview, the term 'Father' holds significant theological and scriptural relevance in describing the relationship believers have with God as depicted in the Bible. By suggesting alternative terms without emphasizing the importance and clarity of the term 'Father' in teaching and context, the student's response falls short in upholding the theological accuracy and scriptural message associated with the term. A clearer emphasis on the significance of the term 'Father' in Christian belief would have aligned better with the concern provided."
