  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of parables used by Jesus to describe the value of the kingdom of God, with accurate references from the Bible. The explanations of each parable are clear and well-presented. However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly highlighting the underlying messages of repentance, redemption, and the transformational power of God's kingdom present in these parables. Adding a brief conclusion that ties all the parables back to the overarching theme of the kingdom of God's value would have improved the response."
