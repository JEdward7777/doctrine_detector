  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer discussing the prophesied defeat of Satan in various religious traditions, including Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. They correctly referenced the Book of Revelation in Christian theology as well as Surahs of the Quran in Islamic tradition. However, the student's answer lacked a direct reference to the specific promise from God regarding the defeat of Satan as stated in the reference answer. Otherwise, their understanding and analysis of the topic were commendable."
