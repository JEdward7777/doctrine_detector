The reference to God's promise of a descendant (the Messiah) defeating Satan aligns well with the Christian worldview and the concern about God's sovereignty and triumph over evil. The response could have further emphasized the unique role of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of this prophecy in Christianity. Nonetheless, the explanation is clear, informative, and consistent with a Christian perspective."
