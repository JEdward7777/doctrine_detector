They accurately articulated the narrative of Satan's temptations and Jesus' victory over evil. However, the answer could have been strengthened by directly stating that Jesus' death on the cross signifies the defeat of Satan's dominion forever, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, the response could have placed a stronger emphasis on the implications of Christ's victory for believers and how it influences their spiritual life, as outlined in the specified concern."
