  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of practical ways Christians can honor God in their daily lives, aligning well with Christian teachings and principles. However, the answer lacks a central focus on thanking and praising God, obeying His commandments, and showcasing His greatness as highlighted in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to ensure their suggestions directly tie back to these core aspects of honoring God in future responses."
