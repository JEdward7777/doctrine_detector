It effectively addresses the concern by outlining the scope of God's communication to humanity as encompassing spoken and written messages, including the significance of Jesus as \"the Word.\" The only improvement could be to directly incorporate the mention of 2 Timothy 3:16-17 as a foundational reference for the concept of Scripture being the Word of God in the answer."
