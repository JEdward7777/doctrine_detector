  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful answer addressing modern examples of idols that Christians might worship instead of God. They have demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of idolatry in Christianity and have identified relevant examples such as material wealth, technology, self-worship, ideologies, and entertainment. The response aligns well with the concern provided and expands on the reference answer by offering a diverse range of examples. The answer could be further strengthened by providing more specific biblical references or theological insights to support the examples given."
