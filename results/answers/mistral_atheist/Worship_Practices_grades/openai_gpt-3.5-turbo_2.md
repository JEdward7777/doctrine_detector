## [Answer](../Worship_Practices.md) by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 As a scholar, it's important to note that the concept of "idolatry" in Christianity refers to placing anything other than God as the ultimate source of one's allegiance or devotion. This can include material objects, ideas, people, or even abstract concepts when they are elevated to the point where they take precedence over God in a person's life.

While it would be inappropriate to assert that individuals are intentionally worshipping idols instead of God, there are some modern examples that could potentially fit the definition of idolatry:

1. Material Wealth and Success: In many societies, particularly capitalist ones, wealth and success are often held in high regard. Some people may prioritize these over their faith or God, leading to a form of idolatry. This is not unique to any particular group but can be found across various cultures and religions.

2. Technology and Science: While technology and scientific advancements have the potential to better our lives and understand the world around us, they can also become objects of idolatry when people place their trust in them more than in God. This can lead to a reliance on human knowledge over divine guidance.

3. Self-Worship: In some instances, individuals may worship themselves as the center of their universe, disregarding the importance of God and others in their lives. This form of self-idolatry can take many shapes, such as narcissism, egoism, or hedonism.

4. Ideologies and Political Beliefs: Some people may become so deeply entrenched in their ideologies or political beliefs that they consider them to be more important than God or faith. This can result in a form of idolatry when these beliefs are prioritized over one's relationship with the divine.

5. Entertainment and Popular Culture: In some cases, people may become so engrossed in entertainment or popular culture that it takes precedence over their spiritual lives. This can manifest as an unhealthy obsession with celebrities, television shows, or music, leading to a form of idolatry when these entertainments are given more importance than God.
