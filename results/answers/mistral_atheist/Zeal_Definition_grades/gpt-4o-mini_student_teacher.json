  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of zeal in the context of Christian teachings, referencing relevant biblical passages such as Romans 12:11 to support their points. However, there was a slight oversight in not directly addressing the concern about understanding the biblical context of zeal for proper application in a believer's life. Encouraging further clarification or expounding on the importance of biblical context would have strengthened the response even more."
