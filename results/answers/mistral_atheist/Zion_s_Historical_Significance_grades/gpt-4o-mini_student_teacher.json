  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of the significance of Mount Zion in relation to King David from both Jewish and Christian perspectives, the answer drifted from the specific historical context outlined in the reference answer. The answer included additional information not directly related to the historical significance of Mount Zion in relation to King David, making it less focused and slightly off-track from the concern provided."
