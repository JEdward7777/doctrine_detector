# Answer by [mistral atheist](../../../answering_models/mistral_atheist.md)
 Mount Zion holds significant historical and religious importance, particularly within Judaism and early Christianity, in relation to King David. It's important to note that this answer is provided from a scholarly perspective without any cultural bias.

Mount Zion was one of the two original hills that comprised ancient Jerusalem (the other being Mount Moriah, where the Temple was located). In the Hebrew Bible, it is often referred to as the "city of David." The significance of Mount Zion in relation to King David begins with his reign. According to the biblical account, after defeating the Jebusites and capturing Jerusalem, David made it his capital (2 Samuel 5:7-10).

King David is said to have built a palace on Mount Zion (2 Samuel 5:11), which would later be completed by his son Solomon (1 Kings 7:1). Additionally, David and his successor Solomon are associated with the establishment of the Temple on Mount Zion, though the actual location was more likely on the adjacent Mount Moriah.

In Jewish tradition, Mount Zion is closely linked with the concept of Zionism, a national movement among Jews that aims at establishing a Jewish state in the territory defined as the Land of Israel. It also symbolizes the continuity and survival of the Jewish people, even during periods of exile.

In Christian tradition, Mount Zion represents the site of the Last Supper (as recorded in the New Testament's Gospels) and is believed to be the location of the Upper Room where the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples on Pentecost (Acts 2). Today, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque stand on the site once associated with King David.
