The student effectively connects the Atonement Lid to the concept of atonement for sins and the covenantal relationship between God and His people. However, there could have been more emphasis on the theological implications of atonement and the foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate atonement on the cross, as seen in the New Testament. Additionally, a stronger integration of biblical references and doctrinal teachings on atonement could have enhanced the depth of the explanation."
