The answer effectively highlights the role of the high priest in representing the people before Yahweh. The response demonstrates a good grasp of the Christian worldview's perspective on the concept of atonement and God's mercy in the Old Testament. However, it could have delved further into the theological implications of the atonement lid in connecting God's justice and mercy in the context of sin and redemption."
